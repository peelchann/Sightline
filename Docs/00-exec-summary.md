# Executive Summary

**Last updated:** October 2025

## What We're Building

Sightline is an AR/AI app that delivers **on-object answers**: see → geo-anchor → ask → AR overlay. Users point their device at a landmark or object, ask "What is this?", and instantly receive contextual information anchored to the real-world target.

## Target Market

Initial focus on **Hong Kong tourism and education** with pilot deployments at heritage sites. Primary users: tourists (18-45), students, and heritage enthusiasts seeking instant, contextual information about their surroundings.

## Why Now

- ARCore Geospatial API (2022+) enables sub-meter outdoor anchoring without prior mapping
- Meta/Ray-Ban smart glasses demonstrate consumer appetite for wearable AR
- Cyberport's XR ecosystem support aligns with Hong Kong's smart city initiatives
- Tourism rebound post-pandemic creates demand for contactless, self-guided experiences

## Competitive Advantage

Unlike Google Lens (no persistent anchoring) or museum audio guides (limited to indoor venues), Sightline combines:
1. Geo-anchored AR overlays that stay attached to real-world objects
2. Natural language interaction ("What is this?" vs. manual search)
3. Outdoor-first design with <2s latency for instant answers
4. Glasses-ready architecture (phones as testbed for future Ray-Ban Meta/Quest integration)

## MVP Outcome

90-second demo at 3 Hong Kong landmarks (Clock Tower, Star Ferry, Avenue of Stars) showing:
- Stable geo-anchored info cards (≥10s tracking)
- Ask-to-overlay latency ≤2.0s (p50)
- Readable outdoor display with leader lines

## 6-Month Milestones

1. **Month 1-2:** Technical MVP (Node API + WebDemo + Unity stub)
2. **Month 3-4:** AR integration (ARCore Geospatial + 3 pilot sites)
3. **Month 5:** User testing (50+ outdoor sessions, latency/UX metrics)
4. **Month 6:** Demo polish + CCMF presentation

## Funding Request

Cyberport CCMF: HKD 500,000 for MVP development, pilot deployment, and user testing.

**Next step:** Submit CCMF application with working demo + pilot site agreements.
