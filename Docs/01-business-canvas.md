# Business Value Canvas

**Last updated:** October 2025

## Target Users

### Primary
- **Tourists (18-45)** — Self-guided explorers seeking instant context about landmarks
- **Students (16-25)** — Learning outside classrooms; visual/contextual learners
- **Heritage enthusiasts** — History buffs wanting deeper knowledge without guidebooks

### Secondary
- Tour operators (B2B integration for group experiences)
- Museum/heritage site managers (visitor engagement)
- Real estate agents (property history/context on-site)

## User Pains (Before Sightline)

1. **Disconnected information** — Must stop, search phone, lose visual context
2. **Poor outdoor UX** — Screen glare, awkward holding phone while reading
3. **Delayed gratification** — 10-30s to search, read, understand vs. instant AR overlay
4. **Generic results** — Google Lens returns web links, not anchored explanations
5. **Indoor-only solutions** — Museum guides useless outdoors; no geo-anchoring
6. **Cognitive load** — Switching between "looking" and "reading phone"

## User Gains (With Sightline)

1. **Instant context** — <2s from "What is this?" to overlay (vs. 10-30s searching)
2. **Anchored learning** — Info stays attached to object; no need to refocus
3. **Hands-free ready** — Architecture supports future glasses (Ray-Ban Meta, Quest)
4. **Outdoor-first** — Designed for sunlight, wide FOV, long-distance landmarks
5. **Conversational** — Natural "ask" vs. typing/tapping searches
6. **Shareable moments** — Screenshot/save answers for later (social sharing)

## Top 3 Use Cases (Hong Kong First)

### 1. Heritage Tourism
**Scenario:** Visitor at Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower asks "What is this?"

**Flow:**
1. Point phone at Clock Tower → anchor appears
2. Tap/say "What is this?"
3. AR overlay shows: "Clock Tower (1915) — Former Kowloon-Canton Railway terminus..."
4. Card stays anchored for 10-60s; user can walk closer/farther, card adapts

**KPIs:**
- Time-to-first-value (TTFV): ≤2.0s
- Anchor stability: ≥10s without re-lock
- User comprehension: 90%+ understand content after 1 read

### 2. Outdoor Education
**Scenario:** Secondary school field trip to Star Ferry Pier

**Flow:**
1. Teacher instructs: "Point at the ferry, ask Sightline about its history"
2. 30 students simultaneously query different angles
3. Each gets anchored overlay: "Star Ferry (1888) — Oldest ferry service in HK..."
4. Students screenshot/save for assignments

**KPIs:**
- Concurrent users: 30+ without degradation
- Content relevance: 85%+ teacher approval
- Engagement time: 3-5 min avg dwell per site

### 3. Neighborhood Exploration (Discovery Mode)
**Scenario:** Expat exploring Sheung Wan, discovers hidden plaques/murals

**Flow:**
1. Walking mode auto-suggests nearby POIs within 50m
2. Point at Graham Street Market → overlay appears: "Historic wet market (1842)..."
3. Discover 5-10 micro-stories in a 15-min walk

**KPIs:**
- Discovery rate: 5+ POIs per 15-min session
- Surprise factor: 80%+ learn something new
- Return usage: 40%+ use app again within 7 days

## Value Metrics

| Metric | Baseline (Without) | Target (With Sightline) | Impact |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Time to answer | 10-30s (search) | <2s (AR overlay) | **5-15x faster** |
| Comprehension | 60% (text only) | 90% (AR + context) | **+50% improvement** |
| Engagement duration | 30s avg | 3-5 min | **6-10x longer** |
| Repeat visits | 15% (Google Lens) | 40% target | **2.7x retention** |
| Outdoor usability | Low (glare) | High (AR overlay) | **Qualitative win** |

## Business Model (Post-MVP)

1. **Freemium** — 10 queries/day free; unlimited for $2.99/mo
2. **B2B Licensing** — Tour operators, heritage sites: $500-2000/mo
3. **Sponsored content** — Restaurants, shops anchor offers: $100-500/mo per POI
4. **API access** — Developers integrate Sightline SDK: $0.10/query

## Social Value (Cyberport CCMF Criteria)

- **Digital inclusion:** Free tier enables equal access to cultural knowledge
- **Heritage preservation:** Digitizes and shares Hong Kong's stories with next gen
- **Education innovation:** Visual/spatial learning for students
- **Tourism recovery:** Supports post-pandemic self-guided experiences
- **Smart city alignment:** Contributes to HK's XR/AI ecosystem development
