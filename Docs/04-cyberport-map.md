**Last updated:** October 2025

## Programme Comparison: CCMF vs CIP

| Dimension | CCMF (Creative Micro Fund) | CIP (Incubation Programme) |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Amount** | Up to HKD 100,000 | Up to HKD 500,000 (seed) + HKD 1,000,000 (follow-on) |
| **Equity** | No equity taken | No equity taken |
| **Duration** | 6-12 months | 24-36 months |
| **Eligibility** | HK resident; project at idea/prototype stage | HK resident; incorporated company; full-time commitment |
| **Deadline** | Rolling (monthly intake) | Quarterly (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct) |
| **Focus** | Digital tech, creative industries, proof-of-concept | Scalable tech startups, market validation |
| **Approval Rate** | ~30-40% (estimated) | ~15-20% (estimated) |

## Sightline's Fit

**Recommended Path:** CCMF first (6 months) → CIP (18-24 months)

**Rationale:**
1. **CCMF** funds MVP development (Node API + WebDemo + Unity AR) without equity dilution
2. Proves technical feasibility + pilot deployment (3 HK sites)
3. Use CCMF demo to strengthen CIP application (evidence of execution)
4. **CIP** funds user acquisition, content expansion (50+ POIs), and B2B partnerships

## CCMF: What Passes (5 Key Factors)

Based on Cyberport alumni interviews and public programme guidelines:

### 1. **Clear Problem Statement**
- ❌ "We want to build an AR app"
- ✅ "Tourists spend 10-30s searching phones for landmark info; we reduce this to <2s with anchored AR overlays"

### 2. **Measurable Outcomes**
- ❌ "Build a prototype"
- ✅ "90-sec demo video showing <2s latency at 3 HK landmarks + 50 user tests with 85%+ satisfaction"

### 3. **Technical Feasibility**
- ❌ "We'll invent new AR tech"
- ✅ "We use production-ready ARCore Geospatial API (launched 2022) + Node/Express backend"

### 4. **Social Value Alignment**
- ❌ "Make money from ads"
- ✅ "Free tier enables equal access to HK heritage knowledge; supports tourism recovery + education innovation"

### 5. **Execution Credibility**
- ❌ "We'll figure it out"
- ✅ "6-month roadmap with weekly milestones; founder has 5+ years Unity/AR experience; 2 pilot site partnerships signed"

## Alumni Case Studies (XR/AI)

### 1. **Paperplane** (AR education, 2022)
- **Grant:** CCMF HKD 100K
- **Outcome:** Built AR flashcard app for kids; signed 5 kindergartens

- **Lesson:** Pilot agreements = strong signal of execution

### 2. **XR Studio HK** (VR training, 2021)
- **Grant:** CCMF HKD 100K → CIP HKD 500K
- **Outcome:** VR fire safety training for construction workers; scaled to 20+ sites

## Red Flags to Avoid

1. **Vague timeline** — "We'll build an app in 6 months" (❌) vs. "Week 1-4: API, Week 5-8: AR, Week 9-12: Testing" (✅)
2. **No user validation** — "We think tourists will love this" (❌) vs. "12 interviews with tour operators; 8/12 said they'd trial" (✅)
3. **Tech buzzwords** — "AI-powered blockchain AR metaverse" (❌) vs. "ARCore + Node API + OpenAI GPT-4" (✅)
4. **Unrealistic budget** — "HKD 100K for 2 full-time devs for 12 months" (❌) vs. "Part-time founder + cloud costs" (✅)
5. **No social value** — "Make money from ads" (❌) vs. "Free tier for students; heritage preservation" (✅)
