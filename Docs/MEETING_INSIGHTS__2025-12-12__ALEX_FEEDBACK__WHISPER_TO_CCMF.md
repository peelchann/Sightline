# Meeting Insights → CCMF Context Pack (from Whisper transcript)

**Source:** `Docs/CURSOR_AGENT_PROMPT__WHISPER_TO_CCMF.md` (raw Whisper transcript pasted by user)  
**Meeting date:** [Uncertain] Transcript contains: “Friday, 12 December 2025 6:25 PM”  
**Attendees:** [Uncertain] At least 2 speakers: Founder and “Alex” (advisor)  
**Purpose (inferred):** Practice pitch / feedback session focused on CCMF/CIP readiness, with heavy emphasis on business model, pricing, scalability, and pitch structure.  

---

## A) Executive Summary (10–12 bullets, high confidence only)

- **Core feedback:** The idea is “very very great,” but the pitch is missing the **business model and pricing**, which is described as “critical.”  
  - Evidence: “you’re lacking… what’s your business model? … what’s your pricing?” / “you didn’t show me how you want to make money” / “this is critical”
- **Buyer focus:** The advisor pushes a **B2B enterprise** buyer model (museums / venues), not a consumer download-driven model.  
  - Evidence: “in general I think only museum could buy your idea” / “persuade people to download your app… investment could be very huge… they’re not interested”
- **Need a scalable acquisition path:** The advisor wants a clear, repeatable **go-to-market path** (analogous to their own webinar funnel example).  
  - Evidence: “what’s your go-to market strategy?” / advisor’s example “YouTube webinar… linear path… acquisition”
- **Pitch structure must change for CCMF/CIP:** You only have **6 minutes**; “every slide you only have one sentence”; lead with market pain + money, not founder bio.  
  - Evidence: “you only have six minutes” / “every slide… one sentence” / “I don’t care about who you are… after I know your project”
- **Key selection risk:** If Cyberport already has similar projects “in their portfolio,” selection probability may drop.  
  - Evidence: “fail rate… high because there’s already similar portfolio… on hand” / “convince them… not being in their portfolio”
- **Differentiation must be ‘why you’, not just ‘the idea’:** “Every idea is possible especially on AI,” so the moat is relationships + experience.  
  - Evidence: “everyone could do this idea… every idea… possible… on AI” / “why should I choose you… because you have connection… experience”
- **Disney relationship is a major asset (“testimonial field”):** Use HK Disneyland track record to make the pitch more persuasive.  
  - Evidence: “very strong relationship with Disney… first testimonial field”
- **“One-person team” is a weakness:** Cyberport “don’t like one person team,” so pitch must emphasize team + execution capacity, not founder-only narrative.  
  - Evidence: “they don’t like one person team” / “speak less about you… more about your team”
- **Product direction shift:** Move from bespoke, one-off projects to a **modular platform + CMS/dashboard**, enabling faster deployment and cheaper updates for venues.  
  - Evidence: “make it… modulized… platform… CMS to manage the content” / “provide them a dashboard… upload different content”
- **A concrete value prop that resonates:** “Launch in **30 days**” + “affordable price” + “venue self-management” (reduce long vendor cycles).  
  - Evidence: “launch… in just 30 days” / “very affordable price” / “decision… very long time”
- **Funding realism:** HKD 100k is not enough to quit a job; scope and plan must reflect that constraint.  
  - Evidence: “CCMF can only give… 100,000 HKD… doesn’t support… quit your job”

## B) Key Insights (grouped)

### Customer / pain points
- **Institution pain:** Long vendor cycles and slow decision-making; expensive one-off builds; inability to update exhibitions quickly.  
  - Evidence: “every decision… very long time” / “they pay a lot… not for a very long time”
- **Visitor pain (mentioned):** Traditional museum content is static (text/audio), doesn’t adapt to interest; phone lookup causes distraction.  
  - Evidence: “audio guides… cannot adapt… only have one kind of instruction” / “phone distraction… notification”

### Product / solution requirements (AR, AI Q&A, UX, stability, content pipeline)
- **Core loop:** Recognize object/place → anchor AR → user asks questions → AI answers, possibly with generated visuals.  
  - Evidence: “recognize what it is where it is… ask question… AI will response… generate… description or image”
- **Multi-device roadmap:** Start phone-first, later VR/Quest and future smart glasses.  
  - Evidence: “for now we will use phone… VR goggles… in the future… glasses”
- **Operations feature:** A venue **dashboard/CMS** is essential (not optional) for institutional buyers.  
  - Evidence: “provide them a dashboard to manage them by yourself… upload different content”
- **Time-to-deploy requirement:** “30 days” becomes a product requirement, not just marketing.  
  - Evidence: “launch… in just 30 days”

### Business model & pricing signals
- **B2B only (primary):** Museums/venues are the practical buyer; consumer model is expensive and unattractive to investors.  
  - Evidence: “only museum could buy your idea” / “download your app… investment… huge… not interested”
- **Pricing must be explicit:** The absence of pricing is repeatedly called out as the biggest weakness.  
  - Evidence: “I didn’t know your pricing model” / “how much is your pricing model”
- **Suggested structure:** “Kickoff bundle” (setup) + recurring enterprise discussion / tiers.  
  - Evidence: “set up a kickoff… bundle… pricing… enterprise level”

### Partnerships / channels (schools, museums, NGOs, gov)
- **Warm-start channel:** Leverage founder’s existing relationships (Disney + museums) to reduce early CAC and secure first testimonial.  
  - Evidence: “Disney… first testimonial field” / “worked with… Science Museum… Heritage Museum… Space Museum… connection”
- **Possible additional verticals (mentioned):** galleries; schools; tourist attractions like “[unclear] Gundam factory.”  
  - Evidence: “gallery… school… Gundam factory”
- **Team sourcing:** Advisor implies team credibility matters; “one person team” is a penalty.  
  - Evidence: “don’t like one person team”

### Risks / blockers (tech, adoption, content, legal/privacy, budget cycles)
- **Adoption risk (primary):** Will venues pay? Budget constraints → “can I not pay you a penny.”  
  - Evidence: “people… budget is limit… can I not pay you a penny”
- **Business viability risk:** CCMF HKD 100k not enough to sustain founder salary; plan must show survival path and PMF approach.  
  - Evidence: “100,000 HKD… doesn’t support… quit your job” / “how… survive… PMF”
- **Copycat risk:** System integrators may replicate concept and sell to other museums.  
  - Evidence: “protect your idea if other system integrator… do a same idea… contract with other museum”
- **Portfolio similarity risk:** If Cyberport has similar portfolio already, selection becomes harder.  
  - Evidence: “similar portfolio… on hand” / “convince them… not in their portfolio”

### Differentiation / positioning
- **Moat is not the idea:** “Every idea is possible” → differentiation must be execution + relationships + credibility.  
  - Evidence: “every idea… possible… on AI” / “why should I choose you… connection… experience”
- **Disney credibility:** Use Disney track record to make “why you” concrete and defensible.  
  - Evidence: “vendor… Disney… holding contract… persuasive”
- **Position as platform, not project:** Move away from bespoke AR projects into modular system.  
  - Evidence: “make… a product… platform… modulize… CMS”

## D) Action Items (RAID style)

### Risks
- **R1 — Portfolio overlap risk (Severity: High):** If Cyberport sees this as already in their portfolio, acceptance probability drops.  
  - Missing info: Any known similar CCMF/CIP alumni projects? What counts as “similar” in Cyberport’s eyes?
- **R2 — Willingness-to-pay risk (Severity: High):** Venues may refuse to pay / seek free alternatives.  
  - Evidence: “can I not pay you a penny”  
  - Missing info: Buyer persona, budget range, procurement constraints, ROI story.
- **R3 — Copycat risk from system integrators (Severity: High):** SI builds similar and sells to other museums.  
  - Missing info: Defensibility plan (IP, speed, distribution, switching costs via CMS, contracts).
- **R4 — Single-founder/team risk (Severity: Medium-High):** Cyberport dislikes “one person team.”  
  - Missing info: Which collaborators are committed + in what capacity (hours/week)?
- **R5 — Funding realism risk (Severity: Medium):** HKD 100k may not cover full-time runway.  
  - Missing info: Founder runway plan, time allocation, whether founder quits job.

### Assumptions
- **A1 — Warm-lead access works (Severity: Medium):** Disney/museum contacts can convert to pilot/LOI.  
  - Missing info: Named contacts, next meeting scheduled, LOI probability.
- **A2 — 30-day deployment is feasible (Severity: Medium):** Product + ops can deliver within that time.  
  - Missing info: Standard operating procedure, scanning workflow, staffing.
- **A3 — CMS reduces churn and creates switching costs (Severity: Medium):** Venues adopt it into workflow.  
  - Missing info: Minimum CMS feature set required by curators.

### Issues
- **I1 — Pitch exceeds time limit (Severity: High):** CCMF/CIP presentation is 6 minutes; current deck too long.  
  - Evidence: “you only have six minutes… you already double the time”
- **I2 — Missing pricing & GTM (Severity: High):** The deck fails to cover monetization and acquisition path.  
  - Evidence: “you didn’t show me how you want to make money” / “what’s your go-to market strategy”
- **I3 — Market sizing missing (Severity: Medium):** Advisor asks “how many museums or Disneyland in Hong Kong?”  
  - Missing info: TAM/SAM/SOM and target segment counts.

### Dependencies
- **D1 — Venue pilot access (Severity: High):** Requires permission to scan spaces and run pilot.  
  - Missing info: Which venue first? Conditions/approvals?
- **D2 — Content supply & approvals (Severity: Medium):** Museums require accurate, approved content.  
  - Missing info: Content pipeline, review process, liability stance.
- **D3 — Tech stack readiness (Severity: Medium):** Object recognition, anchoring, AI Q&A, and CMS must integrate reliably.  
  - Missing info: Current prototype status and gaps.

## E) CCMF Answer Builder (copy-ready bullets)

> Use these bullets as *raw material* for EMS fields. Items labeled **[Uncertain]** require confirmation outside transcript.

### Problem (HK context if mentioned)
- Museums and cultural venues rely on static labels/audio guides that don’t adapt to visitor interest; visitors disengage and go back to phone search (distraction + loss of context).  
  - Evidence: “audio guides… cannot adapt… only… one kind of instruction” / “phone distraction… notification”
- For venues, custom AR solutions are expensive and slow, and they cannot update content quickly across rotating exhibitions.  
  - Evidence: “they pay a lot… not for a very long time” / “decision… very long time”
- **CCMF fit:** CCMF funding is small (HKD ~100k), so the project must be scoped as MVP + validation rather than full commercialization.  
  - Evidence: “CCMF… 100,000 HKD… doesn’t support… quit your job”

### Target users & buyers (who pays vs who uses)
- **Buyer (who pays):** Museums/venues (B2B enterprise).  
  - Evidence: “only museum could buy your idea”
- **Users (who use):** Visitors/students in museums and at landmarks (phone-first; future glasses/VR).  
  - Evidence: “for now… phone… future… VR goggles… glasses”

### Solution & innovation (why now)
- Phone-first AR experience that anchors information to what you’re looking at; user asks questions and AI answers contextually, possibly with generated visuals.  
  - Evidence: “recognize what it is where it is… ask question… AI will response… generate… description or image”
- **Operational innovation:** A venue CMS/dashboard so staff can self-manage content updates without re-contracting vendors.  
  - Evidence: “provide them a dashboard… upload… different content”
- **Why now:** Rapid advances in AI make “ask and see” experiences feasible; devices like Quest and emerging smart glasses expand distribution over time.  
  - Evidence: “latest AI capability… futuristic goggles… future… more powerful model”

### Competitive landscape & differentiation
- Differentiation must be based on **“why us”**: relationships, credibility, and execution capability—not just the idea.  
  - Evidence: “everyone could do this idea… why should I choose you… connection… experience”
- **Unfair advantage:** Strong HK Disneyland relationship and track record can create an early testimonial case.  
  - Evidence: “Disney… first testimonial field” / “vendor… holding contract”
- Risk: System integrators may copy; mitigation must emphasize speed, relationships, and platform/CMS switching costs.  
  - Evidence: “protect your idea if other system integrator… do a same idea”

### Go-to-market plan (first 90 days + 6 months)
- **First 90 days:** Convert existing relationships (Disney + HK museums) into a pilot/testimonial; show tangible “buyer value” (time-to-launch, affordability).  
  - Evidence: “Disney… first testimonial field” / “worked with… Science Museum… connection”
- **CCMF 6 months:** Build modular platform MVP + CMS; validate willingness-to-pay via kickoff bundle + subscription pilots.  
  - Evidence: “platform… modulize… CMS” / “kickoff bundle… pricing”

### Revenue model + pricing hypotheses
- **Pricing must be explicit** in the application and pitch.  
  - Evidence: “I didn’t know your pricing model… how much is your pricing model”
- **Hypothesis:** Kickoff bundle + recurring subscription; enterprise tier for larger venues. **[Uncertain: exact numbers]**  
  - Evidence: “set up a kickoff… bundle… enterprise level”
- Avoid consumer “download and pray” model; investors see it as high-cost, low-probability.  
  - Evidence: “download your app… investment… huge… not interested”

### Milestones & deliverables (CCMF period)
- Deliverable: Modular platform MVP that supports recognition/anchoring + AI Q&A loop + basic CMS.  
  - Evidence: “modulize… platform… CMS… manage the content”
- Deliverable: 1 pilot/testimonial case with a major HK venue (Disney / museums). **[Uncertain: which one]**  
  - Evidence: “Disney… testimonial field” / “Science Museum… connection”
- Deliverable: Pricing model + GTM funnel (repeatable acquisition path).  
  - Evidence: “go-to market strategy” / advisor’s acquisition funnel example

### Budget categories (what we will spend on and why)
> Transcript does not contain a budget breakdown; only the constraint “HKD 100k is small.”  
- **[Uncertain]** Budget should prioritize: MVP build + pilot deployment + scanning/setup + minimal content + measurement/analytics.

### Traction / validation signals (if any)
- Validation signal: Founder claims strong relationships with Disney and multiple HK museums.  
  - Evidence: “strong relationship with Disney… know a lot of their people” / “worked with… Science Museum… connection”
- No explicit signed LOI or paid customer in transcript. **[Uncertain]**

### Team capability & execution plan
- Advisor warns Cyberport dislikes “one person team”; show a credible team story and role coverage.  
  - Evidence: “don’t like one person team” / “speak less about you… more about your team”
- Founder presents broad experience in AR/VR projects, training, and cross-industry work.  
  - Evidence: “eight year in tech… VR, AR… Disney… museums… 100+ school… PMP… scrum master”

## F) Clarifying Questions (max 12, highest leverage first)

1. **Meeting metadata:** What is the exact meeting date, and who attended (names + roles)?  
2. **Pilot commitment:** Which venue is the *most realistic first pilot* (Disney vs Science Museum vs others), and do you have a specific contact + next meeting date?  
3. **Commercial terms:** What pricing range do you want to commit to in the CCMF application (kickoff + monthly), and what’s the justification (cost, ROI, comparables)?  
4. **Scope for “30 days”:** What exactly is included in a 30-day deployment (one exhibit? one room? outdoor landmark?), and what must be true for it to work?  
5. **CMS MVP:** What is the minimum CMS feature set that makes a museum say “yes” (content upload, approval workflow, analytics, localization, etc.)?  
6. **Defensibility:** What is your “system integrator defense” beyond relationships (switching costs, content library, workflows, SLAs, integrations)?  
7. **Market sizing:** How many target institutions in HK are realistic in 12 months (museums/galleries/theme parks/schools), and what segment do you focus first?  
8. **Team reality:** Who on the “team” is committed during CCMF (name/role, hours per week, paid vs unpaid), and what work will they do?  
9. **Founder runway:** Are you quitting your job during CCMF? If not, what is your weekly time allocation, and how does the plan de-risk delivery?  
10. **Content policy:** Who is responsible for factual accuracy and approvals (especially for museums), and how do you avoid AI hallucinations in public-facing content?  
11. **Data collection:** What analytics will you provide to venues (e.g., dwell time proxy, most-asked questions), and what privacy constraints apply?  
12. **Success metrics:** What 3–5 KPIs will you commit to for CCMF (pilot launched, paying customer, deployment time, user engagement, etc.)?
