# Cyberport CCMF / CIP Context Guide

_For Sightline – AR x AI Museum Companion_

This document captures key programme details and unwritten “rules of the

game” for applying to:

- **Cyberport Creative Micro Fund (CCMF)**

- **Cyberport Incubation Programme (CIP)**

- Plus related Cyberport supports that Sightline can leverage.

It is meant to be:

- A **reference for humans** preparing applications / decks, and

- A **context pack for AI agents** (e.g. Cursor / GitHub Copilot / ChatGPT) so

they generate content that fits Cyberport’s expectations and maximises the

chance of success.

>

⚠

 Always cross-check the latest official guides and deadlines on

Cyberport’s website. This document reflects the structure described in recent

briefing materials & sharing sessions, but exact numbers and dates may

change by intake.

## 1. Snapshot of Cyberport Support

### 1.1 What Cyberport Offers (Beyond Money)

From the briefing:

- **AI Supercomputing / Computing Support**

 - Cyberport hosts an **AI computing centre** with subsidised GPU resources

to lower the cost of AI model training/inference for startups, universities and

enterprises.

- **Low-Altitude Economy & Robotics / Drone Sandbox**

 - Testbed and pilot projects for:

 - Medical delivery by drones

 - Drone shows / performances

 - Building façade inspection, etc.

 - Includes a **demo hall for low-altitude economy applications** and an

**unmanned systems centre**.

- **Ecosystem & Networks**

 - Tech partners (e.g. major cloud / tech companies) that can offer solutions

and POCs.

 - **Investor network**: 200+ institutional and individual investors.

 - **Corporate / enterprise network** to create B2B opportunities and pilots.

 - **Professional service network**: legal, accounting, etc., who understand

startups.

 - **Academy**: training with HK and overseas universities.

- **Events & Exposure**

 - Flagship events such as:

 - Digital Entertainment Leadership Forum (DELF)

 - Fintech / digital finance events

 - Entrepreneurship & startup forums

 - These provide **speaking, exhibiting and business matching** opportunities.

These non-financial resources are important to highlight because Cyberport

cares not only about giving money, but also about **which teams can actually

utilise this ecosystem**.

## 2. Core Funding Programmes

### 2.1 Cyberport Creative Micro Fund (CCMF)

**Purpose**

- Early-stage, experimental or concept-stage **digital tech projects**.

- Designed to help founders **validate ideas, build MVPs, and run early

experiments** over a relatively short period.

**Key characteristics**

- **Grant size:** around **HKD 100,000** per project (non-dilutive; Cyberport

does **not** take equity).

- **Duration:** ~**6 months**.

- **Typical use:** MVP development, initial user testing, basic go-to-market

experiments.

**Disbursement pattern** (based on briefing narrative):

- After successful application:

 - **Kick-off grant** (a smaller initial amount).

 - **Mid-term disbursement** at ~month 3, after hitting pre-set milestones.

 - **Final disbursement** at ~month 6, upon project completion and final

review.

### 2.2 Cyberport Incubation Programme (CIP)

**Purpose**

- For more mature early-stage startups (already incorporated) aiming to **scale

and commercialise** over a longer period.

**Key characteristics**

- **Duration:** up to **24 months**.

- **Financial support:**

 - Up to **HKD 500,000** milestone-based financial assistance.

 - Up to **HKD 200,000** in **rental subsidy** (free / subsidised office at

Cyberport’s Entrepreneur Centre during incubation – essentially free workspace

for the 2-year period).

- **Non-dilutive:** still **no equity taken**.

- **Focus:** commercialisation, scaling, market expansion (Hong Kong,

Mainland, overseas).

**Disbursement pattern** (conceptual):

- Initial funding after onboarding and contract signing.

- **Review points** roughly at month 6, 12 and 24:

 - Each review checks progress against pre-agreed milestones.

 - Later tranches (including a performance-based final grant) depend on your

performance and contribution (e.g. awards, fundraising, business achieved,

contribution to Cyberport community).

> The combined effect of CCMF + CIP + Accelerator Support + Market

Development Support can bring **total non-dilutive support to around HKD

1.3M** for a strong startup across the full journey.

### 2.3 Additional Programmes (Post-Incubation)

If Sightline later becomes a Cyberport incubatee or alumni startup:

- **Cyberport Accelerator Support Programme**

 - Subsidises participation in **accelerators / scale-up programmes** (local or

overseas).

 - Up to about **HKD 350,000** in reimbursement for accepted accelerator

programmes.

- **Market Development Support Scheme (MDSS)**

 - Subsidises **overseas or Mainland market expansion activities**:

exhibitions, roadshows, trade fairs, etc.

 - Up to about **HKD 200,000** in total support.

- **Cyberport Investment Arm**

 - Cyberport itself can invest up to around **HKD 20M** in high-potential

portfolio companies.

These are important context for the AI agent: **the application should signal

long-term potential** beyond CCMF alone (e.g. a path to CIP and later

programmes).

---

## 3. Eligibility & Constraints

### 3.1 Common Digital Tech Requirement

Both CCMF and CIP require that the project is within **digital technology**

(broadly defined):

- Examples: AI, AR/VR, gaming, fintech, e-commerce, digital entertainment,

SaaS, etc.

- Sightline fits as:

 - **AR + AI-powered visitor companion** for museums / attractions

 - Integrating mobile AR, VR headsets, and, in the future, AR glasses.

### 3.2 CCMF Eligibility (Early-Stage)

From the briefing:

- **Domain:** must be in **digital technology**.

- **Stage:** project should still be in the **R&D / early development** stage

(idea–prototype–early MVP).

- **No double-funding for the same stage:**

 - If the applicant or project is already funded by **equivalent seed / ideastage schemes** from:

 - Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks (HKSTP), or

 - Hong Kong Design Centre (HKDC),

 - then it **cannot** receive CCMF **for the same project and stage**.

- **No duplication within Cyberport:**

 - The exact same project **cannot** receive overlapping support from other

Cyberport schemes in a conflicting way.

**Application routes:**

1. **Individual track**

 - Main applicant must:

 - Hold valid **Hong Kong resident identity**, and

 - Be **≥18 years old**.

 - Can apply **as an individual** without an existing company.

2. **Company track**

 - Applicant is a **Hong Kong-incorporated limited company**.

### 3.3 CIP Eligibility (Later-Stage)

Key requirements mentioned:

- **Company only:** No individual applications.

 - Must be a **Hong Kong incorporated limited company** (Ltd).

- **Business plan & market timing:**

 - Must have a **feasible business plan**.

 - A minimum expectation that within **12–18 months** the product/service

should be **in the market and gaining traction**.

- **Ownership / Control:**

 - The **founder / core team** must collectively hold **>51% equity** or

effective control of the company.

- **Local presence requirement:**

 - During the incubation period, the company must have at least **one

employee physically working in Hong Kong**:

 - This can be a founder, or

 - A hired local full-time employee.

- **No double-funding with equivalent schemes:**

 - Same as CCMF: if the project at the same stage is already receiving

equivalent seed financing from HKSTP / HKDC etc., then it cannot “double dip”

with CIP.

- **No repeated / duplicate projects:**

 - A previously rejected or funded project must **not** be re-submitted as a

**completely unchanged** proposal.

 - Re-applications are allowed, but Cyberport expects **clear improvements**

and a **description of changes** vs. previous submission.

> The exact company age requirement can vary by intake (e.g. years since

incorporation). Always check the latest official guide rather than assuming a

specific number.

## 4. Assessment Criteria & What Reviewers Care About

### 4.1 CCMF Assessment Dimensions

The briefing describes four main angles:

1. **Project Management Team – Competence & Capability**

 - Founders’ background, skills, execution capability.

 - Whether the team can realistically deliver the proposed MVP within 6

months.

2. **Business / Operating Model & Time to Market**

 - How the project will eventually **make money**.

 - How it will be brought to market (channels, pricing, customers).

 - Whether the proposed timeline to market is realistic.

3. **Creativity & Innovation**

 - Novelty of the solution, use of technology, and differentiation from existing

options.

4. **Social Responsibility** (~10% weight)

 - Positive social impact: e.g. cultural preservation, education, accessibility,

sustainability, inclusiveness.

### 4.2 CIP Assessment Dimensions

For CIP, the emphasis shifts more toward **commercial viability**:

1. **Market Potential & Marketability** (~30%)

 - Size of the addressable market (TAM/SAM/SOM).

 - Evidence of demand and clear customer segments.

 - Competitive analysis and differentiation.

2. **Management Team** (~20%)

 - Experience, track record, complementarity of skills.

 - Whether the team can handle growth and complexity.

3. **Business Scalability & Growth Potential**

 - Expansion plan (geographic, vertical, product lines).

 - How the business can scale beyond Hong Kong.

4. **Entrepreneurial Capability & Problem–Solution Fit**

 - Is there a clear real-world problem?

 - Does the solution meaningfully address it?

 - Quality of the prototype / early product.

5. **Innovation & Social Impact** (~10%)

 - Level of innovation and contribution to society or industry.

### 4.3 Reviewer Mindset (From Alumni Sharing)

Guest founders (Alex & Edy) emphasised that reviewers:

- Are **not just buying “technology”**, they are buying a **solution** to a real

market problem.

- Care about **sustainability**:

 - “If we give you money for two years, will your company still be alive and

growing after the grant ends?”

- Look at whether:

 - You would **pursue the project even without the grant** (grant =

accelerator, not the only fuel).

 - Your **KPIs / roadmap are realistic** (over-ambitious numbers damage

credibility).

 - You have some **real-world signals**: early users, pilots, LOIs, or at least

conversations with potential customers.

This is crucial context for the AI agent when drafting: every section should

quietly answer “Why will this survive and grow in the real world?”

## 5. Application Process & Logistics

### 5.1 EMS Portal

- All applications are submitted via the **EMS online portal**.

- You must register/login with an **email address you check frequently**

because:

 - All official communications, clarifications, and result notifications will be sent

there.

### 5.2 Language Requirements

- **Application form:** English.

- **Pitch deck / PPT:** English.

- **Recorded presentation (if required):** English recommended / often

required.

- **Q&A session:** English is strongly preferred; other languages might be

tolerated but **English preparation is expected**.

### 5.3 Team Information

- The application form requires you to list **core team members**.

- Only those listed as **core team members** can represent the company in

the **pitch / vetting session**.

- The **main applicant (Applicant)**:

 - Becomes the **primary contact**.

 - Is responsible for **signing contracts** if selected.

 - Should be someone with **decision-making authority** in the company /

project.

### 5.4 Required Company Documents (CIP)

For company track applications (especially CIP), Cyberport will request:

- **Certificate of Incorporation**.

- Relevant **company registration forms** (e.g. details of directors,

shareholding).

- These are needed to verify **ownership**, **control** and **legal status**.

### 5.5 Vetting / Presentation Flow

Typical pattern:

- **Shortlisting** from written applications.

- Shortlisted teams invited to a **vetting panel presentation**:

 - **Presentation time:** ~**6 minutes**.

 - **Q&A time:**

 - CCMF: around **4 minutes**.

 - CIP: around **8 minutes**.

- **Timekeeping is strict**:

 - If you overrun, the panel may cut you off.

 - If you don’t manage time, reviewers may miss critical information → lower

score.

### 5.6 Intake Timeline (Example Pattern)

A typical intake might look like:

1. **Application deadline:** early January (e.g. 2 Jan).

2. **Vetting & presentations:** February.

3. **Results announcement:** March.

The exact dates will vary; treat this as **pattern, not truth**. Always rely on the

current intake’s schedule.

## 6. Strategic Tips from Alumni (Alex & Edy)

These are soft but important insights that should guide how any AI agent crafts

content.

### 6.1 Don’t “Sell Technology”, Sell a Solution

- Avoid pitching as “We have cool AR/AI tech.”

- Instead, pitch as:

 > “We solve **[specific, painful, large]** problems for **[clear customer

segments]** using **AR & AI** in a way that is:

 > - Easier to adopt

 > - More effective

 > - Cheaper / higher ROI

 > than current alternatives.”

- For Sightline, this means:

 - Define the pain: outdated museum experiences, passive audio guides, low

engagement with younger visitors, limited on-site staff, etc.

 - Show how Sightline’s AR + AI **changes visitor behaviour and value**.

### 6.2 Always Explain “Why Hong Kong / Why Cyberport”

Cyberport wants to know why **here** and **now**:

- Why is **Hong Kong** strategically important for this project?

 - Gateway between Mainland, Asia, and global tourists.

 - Strong mix of **cultural institutions**, museums, galleries, attractions.

 - Government focus on **tourism, cultural and creative industries, and

innovation**.

- Why **Cyberport**?

 - Access to **AI compute**, **tech partners**, **investor networks**.

 - Credibility: being a Cyberport startup signals quality/trust to local & regional

partners.

 - For Sightline, emphasise:

 - Potential pilots with HK museums / attractions.

 - Prototype as a flagship **“new museum experience” from Hong Kong to the

world**.

### 6.3 Roadmap & KPIs: Ambitious but Achievable

- Panel cares a lot about your **6-, 12-, 18- (and 24-) month roadmap**.

- Recommendations:

 - Break down **realistic milestones**:

 - Product: prototype → beta → production.

 - Business: aligned pilots, first paying customers, expansion to X sites.

 - Team: key hires.

 - Avoid “we will have 1M users in 1 year”-type KPIs with no path.

 - Remember: these become your **contracted KPIs**; they will be used in

reviews.

- For Sightline:

 - 6 months (CCMF): MVP running in 1–2 pilot venues, early user feedback.

 - 12 months: multiple museums / attractions in HK using Sightline; collected

engagement data.

 - 18–24 months: first regional/overseas deployment; packaged SaaS model;

initial recurring revenue.

### 6.4 Traction & Validation Before You Pitch

- Alumni strongly suggest: before facing the panel, you should have:

 - Pitched your solution to at least **~10 potential customers**.

 - Collected **real questions & objections**.

 - Used those conversations to refine:

 - Problem statement,

 - Pricing model,

 - Feature priorities.

- For the AI agent: whenever drafting, assume we want to **show**:

 - That we have already talked with museums / attractions.

 - That we understand their constraints (budget, operational flow, approval

chain).

*(Only include specific names / numbers if they are actually true.)*

### 6.5 Team: Trust + Learning Ability

- Founders emphasised:

 - A startup is a **trust-heavy endeavour**.

 - Having co-founders or core members you’ve known for **5+ years**

increases stability and investor confidence.

 - If the team is very young, adding **experienced advisors** helps.

- What reviewers look for:

 - **Learning agility**: can the team adapt quickly to policy changes, market

shifts, and new opportunities?

 - Evidence that you can update your business plan and model in response to

reality (e.g. new global competitions, policy changes, etc.).

### 6.6 Don’t Over-Index on the Money

- Cyberport is not purely an ROI-maximising investor here; goals include

**ecosystem building and startup success**.

- Reviewers want to see that:

 - **With or without the grant**, you are committed to building this business.

 - The grant makes you **faster and stronger**, not “the only reason you exist”.

For AI-generated text, avoid phrases that sound like “we cannot continue

without funding”; instead emphasise **acceleration, derisking and scaling**.

---

## 7. Submission Strategy: CCMF + CIP

From the Q&A:

- It **is** possible to submit for **both CCMF and CIP in the same intake**.

- However:

 - If accepted into CIP, you will **not** simultaneously hold CCMF for the same

project.

 - If you are rejected, you may **re-apply next intake**, but should:

 - **Explain what has changed**.

 - Show improvements in product, traction, or clarity.

Strategically for Sightline:

- **CCMF**: position as **early-stage product validation**:

 - Building the AR + AI museum companion MVP.

 - Running first pilot(s) in HK.

- **CIP**: position as **scale-up stage**:

 - Converting pilot learnings into a scalable SaaS / platform.

 - Expanding to multiple institutions and markets (HK → GBA → Asia / global).

---

## 8. How the AI Agent Should Use This Context

When generating any CCMF / CIP-related content (application form answers,

PPT bullets, scripts):

1. **Respect Programme Boundaries**

 - If writing for **CCMF**:

 - Emphasise **early-stage validation**, MVP building, experimentation.

 - Keep scope and budget **tight and focused**.

 - If writing for **CIP**:

 - Emphasise **commercialisation and scaling**.

 - Include more detailed **go-to-market strategy**, **revenue model**, and

**expansion plan**.

2. **Always Include These Elements**

 - **Problem** – clearly defined, with real-world context (for museums /

attractions).

 - **Solution** – Sightline’s AR + AI functions and why they are unique.

 - **Market** – size, segments (museums, galleries, theme parks, cultural

attractions).

 - **Traction / Validation** – only include actual pilots, tests or feedback that

are true.

 - **Team** – roles, relevant experience, learning agility.

 - **Roadmap & KPIs** – 6/12/18/24-month milestones that are ambitious but

realistic.

 - **Why Hong Kong / Cyberport** – always explain location & ecosystem fit.

 - **Social Impact** – culture, education, accessibility, tourism experience,

etc.

3. **Language & Tone**

 - Use **clear, professional English**.

 - Avoid jargon where possible or briefly explain it.

 - Present like a **startup pitch deck / business plan**, not an academic paper.

4. **Constraints & Honesty**

 - Do **not invent traction, clients, or numbers** that are not provided.

 - If something is uncertain (e.g. future date), either:

 - Phrase it as a plan (“we aim to…”) or

 - Leave it generic.

5. **Structure for Reuse**

 - Write sections so they can be copy-pasted into:

 - Application form text boxes.

 - PPT slides (e.g. short bullet summaries).

 - Speaker notes for the 6-minute pitch.

---

## 9. Sightline – Suggested Positioning (High-Level)

To keep the context grounded, here is a concise way to describe Sightline that

the AI agent can reuse and adapt:

> **Sightline** is an AR + AI experience platform that transforms how visitors

explore museums and cultural attractions.

> Using smartphones, VR headsets (e.g. Quest 3) and, in future, AR glasses,

Sightline overlays interactive information, story-driven AR scenes and real-time

Q&A onto physical exhibits.

> Instead of passive audio guides, visitors get **visual, conversational and

personalised** experiences, while venues gain **analytics, engagement

insights and upsell opportunities**.

When tailoring for Cyberport:

- Emphasise **digital tech innovation** (AR, AI, future AR glasses integration).

- Ground it in **Hong Kong’s culture, tourism and creative industries**.

- Show how Cyberport’s **compute, networks and events** help Sightline scale

to:

 - Hong Kong museums and attractions,

 - Greater Bay Area institutions,

 - Overseas cultural and tourist destinations.
