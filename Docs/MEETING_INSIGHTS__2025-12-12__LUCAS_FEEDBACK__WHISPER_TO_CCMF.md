# Meeting Insights → CCMF Context Pack (from Whisper transcript)

**Source:** User-pasted “another meeting note” (Cantonese/English mixed; likely Whisper output; speaker labels unclear).  
**Meeting date:** [Uncertain] Text contains “Friday, 12 December 2025 6:25 PM” and “251212 Lucas idea”.  
**Attendees:** [Uncertain] At least 2 speakers. One appears to be **Lucas** (advisor) and **Larry** (founder).  
**Purpose (inferred):** Review/polish CCMF pitch framing: sharpen the “Problem”, narrow initial target segment, simplify deck to fit time constraints, and translate the concept into a concrete scenario + deployment plan + licensing story.  

---

## A) Executive Summary (10–12 bullets, high confidence only)

- The advisor’s main critique is that the **problem statement is not sharp / not an “actual problem”**; it needs a clearer “real-world situation” framing.  
  - Evidence: “呢一句…唔夠出個 problem… 唔 y sharply stand… actual problem”
- The advisor repeatedly pushes to focus the proposition on **personalization** (dynamic content tailored to each person’s interest/preference) rather than generic “AR + AI”.  
  - Evidence: “將個 word focus 係 personaliz” / “dynamic personaliz”
- Suggested narrative shift: today’s content in museums/venues is **static**; Sightline enables **dynamic, personalized content**.  
  - Evidence: “content 都係 static… 有冇多 dynamic personaliz”
- Strong advice to **start with a concrete scenario** (a situation people can picture) rather than abstract tech explanations or too much text.  
  - Evidence: “用…一個 situation… 唔使咁多字”
- Deck structure advice: put your **best demo video** early (even first slide) to capture attention, then explain the problem and the approach.  
  - Evidence: “條 片…擺喺第一板” / “你條片好正”
- Cut the deck down heavily: the advisor suggests moving from ~25 slides to ~12–13 slides.  
  - Evidence: “你而家 25 版… cut 到去 12 版 13 板”
- Avoid over-explaining “AR vs AI” because most people can’t distinguish; emphasize **AI attack** with AR as the interface.  
  - Evidence: “90% 都唔識分 AI 同… AR 只係… interface”
- Initial market focus should be **narrow** and aligned to what funders like; advisor suggests starting with **education** (schools / vocational labs) as stage 1.  
  - Evidence: “擺 school 同… vocational labs… priority… 比較 fit 政府”
- Keep the “big vision” (expand to entertainment/leisure/galleries/tourism/smart city) but move it later; don’t claim a massive market too early.  
  - Evidence: “你而家…好大…唔 realistic… 收尾先講… expand”
- Consolidate redundant slides; combine “why now”, traction/proof/experience into fewer slides; remove low-value slides.  
  - Evidence: “Why now 嗰板…冇用… Traction and proof… combine… 變成一”
- Budget framing: CCMF HKD 100k is small; present it as a simple allocation (equipment + software dev + etc.) without over-detailing.  
  - Evidence: “10萬蚊…好少… purchase equipment… software development…”

## B) Key Insights (grouped)

### Customer / pain points
- **Museum/venue content is static** and not matched to each visitor’s interest; the “problem” should be positioned around lack of dynamic/personalized learning.  
  - Evidence: “content 都係 static” / “每個人個 interest 都唔同”
- The advisor wants a **clear “situation”** people can immediately recognize (e.g., people using paper guidebooks/audio that can’t match viewing pace).  
  - Evidence: “想像…而家啲人…攞住本…聽緊…未必跟得上…速度”

### Product / solution requirements (AR, AI Q&A, UX, stability, content pipeline)
- **Personalization mechanics** implied: over time the system learns user preferences and delivers better personalized content.  
  - Evidence: “用得耐…我可以更加 personaliz… preference”
- **AI-first framing:** AI generates/curates “visible personalized” content; AR is the delivery interface.  
  - Evidence: “用 AI 去 create 啲 visible… personaliz” / “AR 只係… interface”
- You should communicate the platform architecture simply (CMS + AI Q&A + analytics), but shorten the naming/punchline.  
  - Evidence: “寫住 CMS… AI 嘅 Q&A analytic… infrastructure…”

### Business model & pricing signals
- A suggested business model example appears in the transcript: **school licensing** (e.g., “10萬蚊港紙一年”) and a staged rollout plan.  
  - Evidence: “一間學校…一年收一個 license… 10萬蚊港紙一年”  
  - **[Uncertain]** This is advisor-proposed scaffolding, not necessarily an agreed plan.
- Advisor frames revenue from schools as not conflicting with other funding rules (interpreting “school budgets” vs grant restrictions).  
  - Evidence: “學校政府…你係收佢咋嘛… revenue…冇衝突”

### Partnerships / channels (schools, museums, NGOs, gov)
- Advisor suggests using a strong recognizable example early (Disney case/video) to hook attention, then focus on education as stage 1.  
  - Evidence: “第一板…迪士尼…之後… focus… education”
- Possible partners mentioned: CUHK (or “CU” in transcript) as a first POC content partner and pathway into schools.  
  - Evidence: “POC content… CU…之前同…合作過”
  - **[Uncertain]** The exact institution is unclear (“CU” could be CUHK).

### Risks / blockers (tech, adoption, content, legal/privacy, budget cycles)
- **Messaging risk:** Overly broad market claims are “not realistic” and can reduce credibility.  
  - Evidence: “好大…唔 realistic”
- **Comms risk:** People can’t distinguish AI vs AR; over-technical explanations will confuse reviewers.  
  - Evidence: “90% 都唔識分 AI 同…”
- **Deck risk:** Too many slides and redundant content; reviewers won’t watch many videos; pick a few high-impact clips.  
  - Evidence: “唔好擺多片…唔會睇晒…搵返幾條 impact 好啲”

### Differentiation / positioning
- Positioning proposal: **“Exhibition experience platform”** with dynamic/personalized content feed; AI is the differentiator, AR is the interface.  
  - Evidence: “exhibition… platform” / “dynamic… content feed” / “AR 只係 interface”

## C) Decisions + Commitments

> Note: This transcript mostly contains advice; explicit “decisions made” are rare. Items below are phrased as “agreed direction” only when the founder acknowledges alignment; otherwise left as recommendation.

| Decision / Direction | Owner | Due date | Evidence snippet |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Rewrite the problem statement to be sharper and grounded in a real scenario | Founder | [Uncertain] | “problem 寫得唔夠… actual problem” |
| Reframe value prop around **personalized / dynamic content** | Founder | [Uncertain] | “focus 係 personaliz… dynamic personaliz” |
| Put the best demo video on slide 1 (or very early) | Founder | [Uncertain] | “條片…擺喺第一板” |
| Cut deck down to ~12–13 slides and remove redundancy | Founder | [Uncertain] | “cut 到去 12 版 13 板… 25 版” |
| De-emphasize AR vs AI explanation; pitch AI-first with AR as interface | Founder | [Uncertain] | “AR 只係… interface… 講… AI attack” |
| Choose a narrow stage-1 focus (education recommended) and push expansion later | Founder | [Uncertain] | “priority… school… fit 政府… 收尾先講 expand” |

## D) Action Items (RAID style)

### Risks
- **R1 — Problem framing not “real” (Severity: High):** If reviewers can’t instantly see the pain, the pitch fails even with strong tech.  
  - Missing info: What exact “situation” do we open with (HK museum class trip? gallery visit? vocational lab training)?
- **R2 — Over-broad market story (Severity: High):** Claiming too many verticals early reduces credibility.  
  - Missing info: Which single segment is stage 1, and what proof supports it?
- **R3 — Reviewer confusion (Severity: Medium):** Over-explaining AR vs AI loses non-technical reviewers.  
  - Missing info: One-sentence definition and a 10-second analogy.
- **R4 — Deck bloat (Severity: Medium):** Too many slides/videos; reviewers won’t consume it.  
  - Missing info: Which 1–3 clips are “highest impact”?

### Assumptions
- **A1 — Personalization is the “win” (Severity: Medium):** Reviewers value “dynamic personalized content” more than “AR interface.”  
  - Missing info: Evidence or examples from target users (teachers/curators).
- **A2 — Education-first resonates with funder priorities (Severity: Medium):** “Fit government” improves selection odds.  
  - Missing info: Which CCMF scoring section or policy explicitly favors education/social impact?

### Issues
- **I1 — Current problem statement weak (Severity: High).**  
  - Evidence: “唔夠出個 problem…”
- **I2 — Slide redundancy / repetition (Severity: Medium).**  
  - Evidence: “重複咗…多餘”
- **I3 — “Why now” slide low value (Severity: Low-Medium):** Suggested to remove and merge with traction/proof.  
  - Evidence: “Why now 嗰板…冇用… combine”

### Dependencies
- **D1 — A credible stage-1 plan (Severity: High):** If education-first, need access to schools, a POC partner, and a content plan.  
  - Evidence: “POC content… CU… 合作… 3 間… scale 到 10 間”
  - Missing info: Which schools/partners are real vs hypothetical?
- **D2 — Pricing justification (Severity: Medium):** Suggested “school license” price needs justification against real budgets.  
  - Evidence: “每一間學校…每年…五二十萬… target… 五份之一”
  - Missing info: Real HK school procurement/budget data and willingness-to-pay.

## E) CCMF Answer Builder (copy-ready bullets)

> Only include bullets that are supported by this transcript. Where the transcript is “advisor hypothetical”, it’s labeled **[Uncertain]**.

### Problem (HK context if mentioned)
- Current exhibition/museum learning content is mostly **static** and does not adapt to different interests and learning needs; visitors/students can’t get personalized explanations at their pace.  
  - Evidence: “content 都係 static” / “interest 都唔同”
- The real problem should be expressed as a **concrete scenario** (what people do today, why it fails) rather than an abstract tech claim.  
  - Evidence: “用…一個 situation…”

### Target users & buyers (who pays vs who uses)
- **Stage-1 focus suggestion:** Start with **education (schools / vocational labs)** to align with funder preferences; expand later to entertainment/leisure/galleries/tourism.  
  - Evidence: “priority… school… vocational… 收尾先講 expand”  
  - **[Uncertain]** Final chosen segment not confirmed.

### Solution & innovation (why now)
- Build an **AI-first “exhibition experience platform”** that produces **dynamic personalized content**; AR is the interface that presents it in-context.  
  - Evidence: “AR 只係… interface” / “AI… create… personaliz”
- Include **CMS + AI Q&A + analytics** as infrastructure, but keep messaging short and punchy.  
  - Evidence: “CMS… AI 嘅 Q&A analytic… infrastructure”

### Competitive landscape & differentiation
- Many people don’t distinguish AI vs AR; differentiation should be explained as “AI personalization” rather than “AR SDK”.  
  - Evidence: “90% 都唔識分 AI 同…”

### Go-to-market plan (first 90 days + 6 months)
- Focus on **one initial segment** and a staged rollout; don’t claim all verticals at once.  
  - Evidence: “唔 realistic… focus… stage 1”
- **[Uncertain]** Advisor suggested a school rollout plan (e.g., POC partner → 3 schools → 10 schools → long-term 200 schools); treat as a template unless you confirm it’s real.  
  - Evidence: “3 間… scale 到十間… 3 年後… 200 間”

### Revenue model + pricing hypotheses
- **[Uncertain]** Suggested model: annual school licensing (example “10萬港紙一年”) with budget justification using existing school program funding.  
  - Evidence: “10萬蚊港紙一年” / “每年有…五二十萬… target…五份之一”

### Milestones & deliverables (CCMF period)
- Simplify to a small set of measurable milestones that demonstrate “landed” execution; avoid overpromising across huge industries.  
  - Evidence: “build… prototype… focus… executable”

### Budget categories (what we will spend on and why)
- CCMF HKD 100k should be presented as a simple allocation (equipment + software development, etc.).  
  - Evidence: “purchase equipment… software development…”

### Traction / validation signals (if any)
- A strong demo video is treated as an important proof artifact; reviewers should see it early.  
  - Evidence: “條片好正…擺喺第一板”

### Team capability & execution plan
- Reduce “about me” pages; weave proof/experience into earlier slides where it supports credibility, and keep the team proof compact.  
  - Evidence: “Traction and proof… experience… combine… 用入去前面”

## F) Clarifying Questions (max 12, highest leverage first)

1. What is the **exact meeting date** and who is the advisor here (Lucas?) — can we name them in internal notes?  
2. What **stage-1 focus** do you want to commit to for CCMF: education (schools), museums/galleries, or theme parks?  
3. If education-first: do you have **real partner access** (which “CU” is this, and which schools can pilot)?  
4. Which **single opening scenario** do you want as slide 1 + problem statement (HK museum class trip, gallery visit, vocational lab training, etc.)?  
5. Which 1–3 **highest impact videos/clips** will we use, and what is the intended message of each?  
6. Do you agree with “AI-first, AR as interface” framing, or do you want a different “one-sentence” positioning?  
7. Are you willing to state a **pricing hypothesis** publicly in CCMF (e.g., school license fee), or keep it as “pilot pricing TBD”?  
8. If the suggested “HK$100k/year per school” is not real, what price range is realistic, and why?  
9. What are the **6-month CCMF milestones** you want to commit to (prototype + # pilots + KPIs)?  
10. What analytics will be included in the MVP (Q&A logs, engagement metrics), and are there privacy constraints?  
11. Which parts of the transcript are “hypothetical templates” vs. “decided plans” so we don’t over-claim in CCMF?  
12. Should I merge these insights into `Docs/CCMF_Answers_EN.md` (marking any unconfirmed items as **[Uncertain]**)?
