## 0) How to use this context (for CCMF + Cursor)
- Use this as a **strategy lens**: why-now framing, two idea branches, and how to align the *chosen* branch to CCMF scoring.
- When drafting CCMF answers, pull language from **Sections 1, 3, 4, 5** and map to: Team / Biz Model & Time-to-market / Innovation / Social Responsibility.
- Do **not** quote Sam Altman or other public figures as “said X” unless you add a real source; use the “platform shift” framing instead.
- Treat Idea A (“SME discoverable by agents”) as a **separate exploration**, not the CCMF core story.
- Use “Open Questions” as your checklist for what to decide before final submission.

## 1) Why it’s “the best time to build” (your thesis)
### 1.1 Core belief (why-now)
- We are in a platform shift where AI moves from **chat on screens** to **agents + multimodal perception** (vision/voice) and, eventually, **wearables**.
- This shift creates openings for new **default interfaces** (new workflows users adopt daily), not only incremental apps.
- The opportunity is to build something that lives “in the world” (spatial context) instead of being trapped in web/app UI.

### 1.2 CCMF translation (what reviewers should hear)
- The “why now” is not hype; it should translate into an MVP that is:
  - shippable within **6 months**,
  - shows value within ~**3 months**,
  - has concrete HK use cases and measurable outcomes.

> **[Needs verification]** You referenced “Sam Altman said it’s the best time to build a startup.” If you want to use this in a written application, keep it as a general industry sentiment unless you provide a specific sourced quote.

## 2) Idea A (separate track): “Make SMEs discoverable to AI agents”
### 2.1 One-liner
Enable SMEs (including non-web-listed) to be **found + transacted** by AI shopping agents (e.g., agents buying groceries on behalf of users).

### 2.2 Customer + problem
- **SMEs**: lack structured catalogs, inventory feeds, APIs, clean pricing data, and often reliable online presence.
- **Agents/agent platforms**: can’t reliably query “real-world local supply” without standardized, verifiable merchant data.
- **Users**: want agents to buy locally and conveniently, but agents can’t “see” local options reliably.

### 2.3 YC-style “what is the service?”
Build a “merchant-to-agent bridge”:
- **Onboarding**: capture/storefront → product catalog digitization → SKU/variant normalization.
- **Freshness**: price/availability updates; correctness guarantees; audit trails.
- **Transactions**: order creation, payment rails, fulfillment confirmation, refunds.
- **Trust**: verification, anti-fraud, policy compliance, dispute resolution.

### 2.4 Business model directions (early hypotheses)
- B2B SaaS: pay to be agent-discoverable + managed catalog.
- Transaction fee: commission per agent-initiated order.
- Data licensing: structured product feeds for platforms (risky; commoditizes).

### 2.5 SWOT (high level)
**Strengths**
- Large market if agent commerce becomes mainstream.
- Potential network effects (merchant coverage + reliability).

**Weaknesses**
- Operations-heavy (onboarding, verification, logistics integration).
- Cold-start dynamics (need both merchants and demand).

**Opportunities**
- “Agent economy” creates new distribution channels.
- SMEs need digitization and automation anyway.

**Threats**
- Incumbents (marketplaces, delivery platforms, payments).
- Regulation and liability for transactions/fulfillment.
- Commoditization of “feeds” and catalog tooling.

### 2.6 YC-style scorecard (subjective, from your stated concerns)
- **Scalability**: 8/10 (if you solve onboarding + standardization)
- **Uniqueness**: 5/10 (many will attempt “agent commerce rails”)
- **Feasibility (solo/early)**: 4/10 (ops + partnerships heavy)
- **Overall YC readiness**: 5–6/10 (depends on a sharp wedge + early traction)

## 3) Idea B (primary for CCMF): Sightline — AI + AR/XR “answers on the world”
### 3.1 Vision
AI should not live only on web/apps. The next interface is **in the physical world**:
**look → ask → see an answer anchored to the object/place** (not a generic link list).

### 3.2 Core loop
**See → Anchor → Ask → Overlay**
- The “magic moment” is a stable, readable **anchored card + leader line** that stays attached as you move.
- Long-term: “Google, but you don’t need to take out your phone” (glasses-first eventuality).
- Near-term: phone-first MVP to prove feasibility + value quickly.

### 3.3 Technical direction (as described)
- **Outdoor (phone)**: GPS/geo anchoring for landmarks; optionally ARCore Geospatial later.
- **Indoor / high accuracy**: vision + SLAM-style anchoring (Vuforia-like / Area Target-like workflows).
- **Vision model inspiration** (“nano banana” + SAM2 in your notes):
  - use strong visual intelligence + segmentation to anchor an info box to the correct object region.
  - treat as an R&D inspiration; do not claim availability/rights without verification.

### 3.4 Practical constraints you surfaced
- Quest 3 has limitations outdoors; GPS isn’t available; long-distance anchoring is hard.
- A credible MVP path is required: start with what can ship and be tested quickly.

## 4) YC-style packaging for Sightline (how to make it fundable)
### 4.1 Wedge-first framing
- Pick a narrow first wedge (museum/heritage/school field trips) that creates:
  - a clear buyer,
  - a short sales cycle (or at least reachable pilots),
  - measurable outcomes (engagement, dwell time, learning outcomes, satisfaction).

### 4.2 Avoid “demo-only” risk
- The product must be framed as a repeatable platform, not a one-off AR project:
  - templates, content pipeline, CMS path, analytics path.

## 5) Cyberport fit: CCMF vs CIP
### 5.1 CCMF (HK Programme) — best fit “first”
- 6-month project period; demonstrate MVP progress quickly (often within ~3 months).
- Application via EMS with project details; scoring emphasizes:
  - team capability,
  - business model/time-to-market,
  - creativity/innovation,
  - social responsibility.

### 5.2 CIP — later-stage
- More stringent company/eligibility requirements (HK limited by shares, founders ≥51%, etc.).
- Vetting commonly includes multiple stages and a presentation/Q&A.
- Better when you have stronger product readiness and clearer scaling plan.

## 6) What you want from Cyberport beyond money
- Mentoring/coaching to compensate for limited entrepreneurship experience.
- Ecosystem access: partners, workshops, credibility, potential space/coworking.
- Clarity on “other HK funding” and whether funding can be stacked (**verify rules per intake**).

## 7) Personal constraints + execution plan you’re considering
- You are considering quitting a full-time job but fear:
  - financial stability,
  - future family obligations,
  - regret if you don’t try.
- You want a **6-month trial** with:
  - monthly review checkpoints,
  - a hard **3-month milestone gate** (continue/pivot/stop based on evidence).
- You are currently constrained by being solo and having limited Unity skill; you want the fastest path to a credible prototype.

## 8) Open questions to resolve before final CCMF submission
1. Which MVP device path will you commit to: WebAR phone vs Unity ARCore vs hybrid?
2. What’s the first “pilotable niche”: museum tours, heritage routes, school field trips, etc.?
3. Who is the first paying customer (buyer) and what is the pricing hypothesis?
4. What specific Cyberport resources will you use, and how exactly do they accelerate delivery?
5. What are the success metrics for Month 1–3 that decide whether you continue full-time?
6. What claims about models (“nano banana”, SAM2) are verified vs inspiration-only?
