# Cursor AI Agent Prompt (copy/paste)

## Role
You are a senior venture analyst + product strategist helping me turn a noisy Whisper meeting transcript into (1) reliable meeting insights and (2) structured context I can reuse to answer Cyberport CCMF application questions for my startup.

## Inputs I will provide
- Project context (below)
- A Whisper transcript (inaccurate, may contain wrong words, missing punctuation, speaker confusion)

## Project context (fill in)
- **Project name:** [Sightline / your name]
- **One-line description:** [AI-native AR “Exhibition Engine” for schools/museums; phone AR + Q&A; optional VR/Quest experience]
- **Meeting date + purpose:** [e.g., stakeholder sync about pilots, budget, scope, partnerships]
- **Who attended (if known):** [names/roles]
- **What I need next: CCMF focus areas:** [Problem, Solution, Innovation, Market, Revenue, GTM, Traction, Budget, Milestones, Risks, Team]

## Primary objectives
1. Extract high-confidence meaning from the transcript: key points, decisions, assumptions, constraints, and insights.
2. Produce CCMF-ready context: reusable bullets mapped to typical CCMF answer areas (problem/solution/market/model/plan/budget/etc.).
3. Identify gaps & ambiguities: list questions you need me to answer to firm up the CCMF narrative.

## Critical rules (anti-hallucination)
- Do not invent facts not supported by the transcript or my provided context.
- When uncertain, label clearly: **[Uncertain]** and provide 1–3 plausible interpretations with confidence levels.
- Prefer quoting or referencing short excerpts from the transcript to justify key conclusions.
- If names/terms are garbled, normalize them only if you’re confident; otherwise keep as **[inaudible/unclear term]**.

## What to produce (strict output format)
### A) Executive Summary (10–12 bullets, high confidence only)
What happened, what matters, why it matters for CCMF.

### B) Key Insights (grouped)
- Customer / pain points  
- Product / solution requirements (AR, AI Q&A, UX, stability, content pipeline)  
- Business model & pricing signals  
- Partnerships / channels (schools, museums, NGOs, gov)  
- Risks / blockers (tech, adoption, content, legal/privacy, budget cycles)  
- Differentiation / positioning  

### C) Decisions + Commitments
Decision | Owner | Due date (if any) | Evidence snippet

### D) Action Items (RAID style)
Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies  
Include severity and what info is missing to close each item.

### E) CCMF Answer Builder (copy-ready)
Provide bullets under these headings:
- Problem (HK context if mentioned)
- Target users & buyers (who pays vs who uses)
- Solution & innovation (why now)
- Competitive landscape & differentiation
- Go-to-market plan (first 90 days + 6 months)
- Revenue model + pricing hypotheses
- Milestones & deliverables (CCMF period)
- Budget categories (what we will spend on and why)
- Traction / validation signals (if any)
- Team capability & execution plan

### F) Clarifying Questions (max 12, highest leverage first)
Ask only what materially improves CCMF answers.

## When you are ready
Tell me exactly how to paste the transcript (preferred: with timestamps/line breaks), then wait for my transcript.

## What you should tell / ask Cursor before pasting the transcript (quick checklist)
- **What the meeting was for:** “This meeting was about: pilots / pricing / partnerships / product scope / budget / timeline.”
- **What output you want:** “I need CCMF-ready bullets + decisions + action items + risks/assumptions + open questions.”
- **Your non-negotiables:** “No hallucinations. Mark uncertainty. Use evidence snippets.”
- **How you want it structured:** “Map insights into CCMF sections (problem/solution/market/model/GTM/budget/milestones).”
- **Any known fixed facts:** “Project name, target sector (HK schools/museums), core features (phone AR + AI Q&A; optional VR/Quest).”

## How the transcript is formatted
“I will paste raw Whisper text; may have wrong speaker labels. Please infer cautiously.”

## Whisper transcript (raw paste from user)

fail rate would be very high because there's already similar portfolio already on they're already on hand
right
so yeah that's that's the critical part so um I I should let you know because one when I u I have an agent who helped me to apply with it and my agent just let me know because my ideas is e-commerce and e-commerce is the scarcity very very rare ideas ideas in Hong Kong and in Singapore there's very rare ideas about this. So that's why I'm
be honest uh they said my idea is easier than other
yeah than other project.
Yeah.
Yeah. So it looks uh it means that your idea is about looking for the AR or something. Um I will say I wouldn't say that your failure could be pretty high or not but uh I think the important is that you needed to convince them this idea is not being uh in their portfolio or in their idea. Yeah.
Right. Right. Okay.
Yeah. Otherwise because I've heard that if some ideas already being chosen in Y comodator there they probably cannot be selected with CCMF or CIP.
Okay. So I need to check for like previous is there like project is uh apply for CCMF or science club or even and YC and see if there is like similar idea and and I need to
yeah this idea is already exist or not yeah because if your idea is already being exist that could be more difficult and otherwise uh otherwise they would say um they would think the first thing is idea your idea is new item in their portfolio this is the first thing the second thing is that why you
right
as what as I I I think I I've talked this yesterday, right? Why you why should I choose you? Because everyone could do this idea and in nowadays every idea uh I don't think that worth that much because every idea could be possible especially on AI everything. So this ambassador they focusing more on why you
right
because you have connection, you have experience or if you have a very strong Yeah,
that others cannot break through with that. Otherwise, you cannot
and I I believe that every investor, every customer would ask you why I choose you, why I choose your product, why do you choose others,
right?
You need to give uh not just an idea because uh uh to be honest be uh let me be very straightforward how you don't mind.
Uh because nowadays every idea people already seeing many ideas and you know for my territory every day people would say if I could just use Excel to manage my advertising
I don't want to use uh yeah I would like to use your service you use your advertising tools but can I not pay you a penny
251202 Alex idea
Friday, 12 December 2025 6:25 PM
Uh because nowadays every idea people already seeing many ideas and you know for my territory every day people would say if I could just use Excel to manage my advertising
I don't want to use uh yeah I would like to use your service you use your advertising tools but can I not pay you a penny
people would like ask you things because their budget is limit and anything so they would think oh if your product is good enough otherwise I mean you I may not change it.
Right?
So this is the first thing that that's why I want to say uh yesterday I would say uh you shouldn't focusing only on the uh this application. You need to focusing on your product is already being attractive to the specific park audience.
Like I said if you your previous park audience is like a water Disney or something so you've already Hey, if you already um being a have a strong relationship like your company is the vendor for uh W uh W Disney that is pretty important because you already holding the relationship you hold a re contract on hand
right
so that's why you could use that that that could say if I if I were you I would say I would speak a story like say oh yeah because I we have very strong relationship with Disney so and Disney could be our first testimonial field,
right?
That that's why I could so and I've accomplished that Disney could provide us like uh how many characters as the first running blah blah blah. So people would say even the same project idea. So you have a background relationship with Disney and something that's been more persuasive.
Understood. Understood.
Yeah.
Good point.
Yeah. Sorry, I just talk about money. Yeah. I usually talking only talk about the money.
No, no, no. It's totally fine cuz I I think it's really really like straightforward and and honest comment for I I really really take it into cons consideration and actually I I have like a 10 few slides about like who I am and what I did and and what is my idea cuz can you like give me or like few uh less than like 10 minutes?
Yeah, you could just uh sharing and I would give a quick
Yeah, just quick slide. Yeah,
I have some slides. So I can
be honest I'm just like the other uh speaker because I don't have much time. So every speaker just like me I I the only time I I have to read your PPT is right now.
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
Yeah. So yeah this will be very uh real real simulation.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This I I'm I'm really looking forward. So I I will go really quickly and I grab the points so that you can uh have more uh concept about what what I'm proposing
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This I I'm I'm really looking forward. So I I will go really quickly and I grab the points so that you can uh have more uh concept about what what I'm proposing right so um my product is called sighteline is a onobject answer for the real world so um imagining because um there's a lot of sightseeing places or imagining you're in a museum most of the time there's like a pictures or some sculptures but you definitely would like to know more such as um what is this sculpture did who did this and who draw this what is the history behind all kind of stuff like that But with traditional um museum it can only be understand with with the text on raw. So what if with we can have AI or even we have uh AI technology that we can have this kinds of information appear on this kind of object then it will be a much more interactive and more fun way to understand a museum or understand the world and it is what my vision is looking about. Okay. So um Why me? So um maybe talk about me. Uh I've just said that uh I have eight year in tech. I done a lot of VR, AR, VR training with Fin Parks, Hong Kong DC land, uh CU, HK, CSL and 100 plus school cuz and also I have done a lot of project with Hong Kong Science Museum before and also I'm PMP certified uh scrum master. So I know all the methodology to how to bring a team and also I do a lot of AI stuff to uh do I even have a uh five coing uh product is open source. I did it on myself which is helping the car to fit the color or something like that. I I I really enjoy doing this. So um eight years in in in digital product and five a u mink AR release with the Hong Kong DC land more and I also have a VR training uh which is a award-winning VR application did with CK which is have 2,000 more than 2,000 users uh play with it to do some kind of baby training and also I earn a ICT award and also I have managed it um which is uh 3.2 millions promotion which is called 5G AR lenses is also u telecom and marketing to spread around the coupons and also um just a lot of project I've managed is across six industry theme park telecom aviation uh education all kind of that so I'm quite a lot of experience in this sector and um in my the Hongong this event uh we have shipped like five projects such as from the Duffian friends and uh is like the PC to prove his work and then we work for the first AR launch in World of Fosen which is the first of uh eight kinds of AR experience in Hong Kong Disneyland and we even um bring it to a whole new level to the uh which is um the whole uh the whole world of Disneyland is um not equipped with this kinds of technologies which is the area target. We recognize the area and they have this kind of um AR application. So what we did is we scan the whole we scan the whole area and then we use our AR capability to show a stunning fireworks uh and people can enjoy those on phone. So this is some of the experience to be shown on uh uh And even uh the latest um Kaida experience which is the kind of stadium we have launched a AR experience on it and uh we have some Disney character or Mickey Mouse show over there then the guests really enjoy those. So it is some really huge project that I deliver with Disney. So another is award-winning VR training. So the ping point is um there's some very dedicated baby we we cannot take care of cuz uh they are very uh easily uh to be hurt but uh in the same time we need to take care of them. So how can uh the the baby carrier can gain more experience without risk of uh um um hurting those babies. So we did a project with CK and uh we have de developed a program that we have talked with like speech therapists, physical therapists and then learned a lot of some realistic scenarios and we put them in into a VR program. You can see the people is wearing a VR goggles and then he's using a controllers to do a lot of how to help baby to to feed the babies, how to help it help him or she to uh change diapers, all this kind of things. So I also um earn a ICT award for this kind of VR training. So this project prove I'm really into AR and VR and all my passion in is in this industry. And what sparked my ideas about the uh sight line this product is about like Lo banana is the latest uh AI AI capability but in the same time it can have some kind of resource intelligence to like look at the golden bridge okay it is a golden bridge uh when it is built who build it so it's more like a interactive uh learning experience or even you can ask well but without Google you do not need to type words but just put on uh use the phone and I envision that we can use some uh futuristic goggles to put on and anchor the world and look at the world and understand the world with these kinds of technologies. So the problem is like um previously we have audio guides but um and general uh generic uh generic app but actually do not adepts with wister interest. So they have like maybe interest in history or technology we cannot that we can only have one kind of uh uh instruction. So and also um for phone distraction is easily uh like uh lotification all kind of that and also it will be hard for data collection how is the people interactive with this kinds of uh uh exhibition. So with that said sighteline could be help helping this kind of situation we in the first um prototype we would like to use the phone so that uh we when we like such as point at this kind of clock tower we can recognize this tower and say okay just like um when is it built what is the heat history behind it and how uh and what is the technology or even we
this kind of clock tower we can recognize this tower and say okay just like um when is it built what is the heat history behind it and how uh and what is the technology or even we can customize to like different person or different interest such as if someone is more into engineer, he can more ask more engineer stuff but someone is more like history um she can he or she can ask more about like the what is the history about and there will be a lot of information or even graphics that can be generated um in the in the in the real time. So this is like a imagination video. What if answers lived on what you're looking at? If what am I looking at? Clock Tower, former KCR terminus nearby Graham Street Market. It's like subtitles for the city. Sight line on object answers.
So, it is like a quick demo about like how how will be uh it be used such as uh when you look in the cities the the smart glasses or the phone can um can quickly pop some informations about it or even this uh Mona Lisa drawing language is very uh famous but in the same time it's very hard for the people to grasp like what is it about who draw it what is the history about it so if we can have this kind of technology we can uh look at it and there's information that will be much more interactive and uh people will be much more engaging for this kind of exhibition
on the art you're seeing sighteline anchors context to the Mona Lisa no scrolling no guessing ask the AI for deeper detail then save it for later sight
okay so this is another maybe a a Start with the view. You know,
sight line anchors context to what you're seeing.
How do clownfish avoid being stung by the anemone? Ask and see the answer on the glass. Sight line on object answers for the
Yep. Uh and also maybe I will show one more. Um here's some um
what if the lesson lived on the masterpie?
And also the
what if cities explain themselves as you walk?
Maybe the city in Japan, Shibuya. We can ask for the landmarks. And also this is like a dinosaur explain themselves. Sight line anchors
when you look at a dinosaur and recognize it.
How powerful was it?
And then you can ask question and then you can see the answers appearing on the glass object answers for the real world.
What if
so is more like a a to summarize to summarize it is like seeing something and then we can use AR to anchor it because it's recognize what it is where it is and then you can ask question and the AI will response you and and then use the AI capability to generate a description or image and then then you can have on object AR answers. So that is what we are emerging about and for for now we will use phone or we can use a um VR goggles like quest but in the future because matter is uh releasing a lot of glasses metal wave band or waveband displays is like very um innovative style that we can uh empower the solution to be used in the future. So I'm imagining we can have short-term uh short-term solution but in the same time we have a a long vision that we can have this application to be adopted in different devices so that it can be applied in different uh industry or in the future it will be more interactive such as the model is is uh latest model will be much powerful and then we can switch model and then we can have a more powerful uh version of site line. So this is uh the the road map and I think uh that's it for I think I
version of site line. So this is uh the the road map and I think uh that's it for I think I
Yeah.
Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah. Uh L just let you know um
Yeah. I think there's some point you needed to maybe you need to rephrase your all slides.
Yeah. Yeah.
Because uh
uh I give you an idea that um
you know CCMF or CIP when you need to present you only have six minutes.
Yeah. Right. Definitely. Yeah.
Yeah. So you already double the time.
Yeah. Sorry. which means every slide you only have one sentence.
Yeah, just one sentence. You you just use only one sentence to introduce you. And I think the
uh I give you some my opinion. Yeah. Just I think that's very great idea. Very very great idea. Yeah. But I think you you're lacking very key important that what's your business model?
What what how what's your pricing? because of these things as far as I think uh just based on my observation people won't pay it. Yeah, some people may pay for this if it's a downloaded app or something
but in general I think only museum could buy your idea
right
so your idea need to if you want to scalable how do you scalable with that because you want to uh what's your scalable strategy like what I said that You know when I pitch to CIB I would say my strategy is using YouTube and I hosting I host a YouTube webinar to teach people how to uh running business on crossber e-commerce and then once they finish it and they engage with us we have a very linear path to ac uh to do the acquisition of customer. This is my path
but for you uh the first thing I I wouldn't I didn't know your pricing model.
Yeah. Yeah. That's
how much is your pricing model and how would like to charge your mo because uh I I give you a very
uh sorry just make uh I I just give you maybe my straightforward they would think because uh
if you want to survive I I I'm not really sure your salary level but I would say uh think you're I think you're very talented. people and uh I think in Hong Kong they could be uh 50,000 50,000 or
50,000 50,000 or
100,000 per month
and you need to survive you need to live you need to pay everything and
the only thing right now your idea is talking about you
and uh I would consider that what's your business development team
who will help you to discuss some other museum or the only client is is the only client is your Disneyland that is fine because you would say you could just tell me okay Disneyland is your first testimonial case and you would persuade them to buying this idea so free use for clients and I sell this technology to this museum so that would be extensive questions how to protect your idea if other system integrator. They saw your idea. Oh yeah, this idea uh pretty looks pretty promising. Let me do a same same idea and I I have another contract with other Chen Chen museum,
right?
Everyone knows that. So this is very pretty important. So how many museum or how many places or how many tourists you already persuade them to buy your idea like like I say I you could could just tell me that my idea already I've already convincing all these take take buying this idea that is fine that is also fine
yeah but in your slide I didn't you didn't show me how you want to make money
right that's that's
this is critical
that's critical that's critical
yeah because for my idea if you see my slides every part I'm talking about how I'm making money
right
I've already can make money my business model is I I think this is promising idea and I think my pricing ability is pretty good because no one's do that.
No one do idea that is the first things but but people would buy if people would buying your idea or not that's the most critical part
right that's correct
and how do you scale it because the you know as a as let me as an investor to ask you if I were investor oh yes your idea looks pretty good and This land already give you a promising. So why why you need me to invest you? Why
because you already have a technology already making you already making money you you need to like let let me give you a example that if get Disney signed a contract with you was 10 million USD dollar contract. Do you want to do this business? Do you want to scale this? Maybe you don't want. So why you need my investment. No, you don't want
you already make money, right? So, there's no role for CCMF or other to bring in your ideas. So, this is pretty important. And for business idea, I want to say uh I I'm just give you some quick ideas like uh how to scale your business, what's your business I what's your business uh core, how to conserate it, you how do you persuade this museum or this Disneyland to buying your service. I think that's the most important. You you shouldn't you think idea you you want to persuade people to download your app because uh if you focusing on this part the investment could be very huge and many investor already failed
focusing on this part the investment could be very huge and many investor already failed in this kind of investment. So they're not interested in this idea
right?
Yeah. So I think to to business to enterprise that's more that's more important and I think every uh audience would think would have a similar idea as mine but they wouldn't tell you yeah so this is my basic idea you you need to you're talking about how do you make money
and you how to making survive how do you make a PMF you that's what I say because G cyber CCMF can only give you about 100,000 Hong Kong dollars this first year Yeah.
That amount doesn't support you their idea. That amount doesn't for you to quit your job to do the full time about this.
Yeah.
Yeah. So this is pretty important. So do you want to quit your job to do this? What I'm thinking that to your slide I I don't think you're ready to do this and this would be very uh I think all the attendant would have a similar idea. So they would probably not take this idea. But I think this idea and technology is very interesting. So if I were you, I would just to change some module maybe I would say I already have a business module and uh only when I talking to this museum they only to input the content and I could launch their launch there this kind of this service in just 30 days. That's pretty important because this museum already they have contract with supplier and everything. So every decision they take them very long time and you can give them very affordable price to do this. That is pretty important,
right? That definitely a good point. Definitely a good point.
Yeah. So they will do this so you will save their money and quickly to launch it and also you provide them a dashboard to manage them by yourself. Maybe later you could upload a different content. Maybe the museum have different collection into the museum. So they want to change it. They will do this. That's pretty important. And I I think the attendant must ask you these things. So if all your service can do this but
you don't need it to be all automation but maybe semi-automations or modulize and uh the second thing you could tell them we've seen that the market there is so many mark museum are doing this because on on your slide I only saw the technology how difficult it is and how it is but I didn't see how how much the total market is like this. Uh do you know how many museums or Disneyland in Hong Kong?
Um I'm talking Yeah, I think you you uh really hit hit a critical uh uh weak weakness right now. So uh I Disneyland is a strong uh relationship with with me. I I know a lot of their people. So definitely we uh we can try something with them. And also I I previously worked with multiple like Hong Kong Science Museum, the heritage heritage museum, space museum and I have a connection with all these kinds of museum and um for the people that I think I can go on is maybe the gallery cuz um in the in one of the video I show it uh such a small Lisa but I think that is definitely a good point. I I need to make it like a modulized uh modularized style. So maybe to make it uh for the museum is using like a low low price than other projects. So previously I thought do a lot of project like this but in the same time they because it's like one off for them it's very like um they pay a lot and then it's not for a very long time maybe I can do it like a product and then I make a platform just like what you said and modulize or even a CMS to manage the the content or the AI so that is for different uh museum or gallery to on board or even some educations or even I'm thinking like Gundam factory some such as the tourists go there and then they sees Gundam and all this kind of thing. So I'm I'm um imagining or even school is also possible. So I imagining maybe we I need to u make a system so that it modulize it reduce the cost so that I need to as a package of uh and and I need to kind of like what is the capital that
like what is the capital that
yeah that's pretty cool. So you can you can set up a kickoff kickoff bundle let's say you could pricing it and a big enterprise you have enterprise level to to discussion and I think that that could be make this business plan more feasible and the critical important that
uh let me just tell you cyber for science part they don't like one person team
yeah uh um
yeah so
I give you some opinion maybe find some of you uh say in museum or something some people you putting them the slide you don't say you you instead you need our team we have strong relationship,
right?
That's very important. So, speak less about you. Speak le more about your team,
right?
They don't Yeah. I I know be honest. We know every relationship is around with founder like our company most 80% relationship is around with me. But that that is fine. But when we do the presentation, I would say our team is all our team's effort
because people would think if you drop or you quit the job it would fail the project would fail
or not people's that that's not the idea they think so this is really important so if you're launching service for this kind of museum something I would say that that's a very great niche so you could do the pricing like say your pricing maybe is uh I'm not very sure so you need to calculate how many museum how many Disneyland they would use and how much they would pay by your service so you could you could things like do a normal business plans you could use in Gemini 3 Pro let's say to to just estimate uh how much you could you could earn you could make money on this project
yeah that's pretty important
yeah yeah
if you could see that I think this idea would only be the project for this kind of and uh this kind just kind of another web development project something would be yeah uh sorry my English is not that good.
No, no, it's totally fine. It's really great because I I really heard some really really honest comment and I I think it helped me a lot and and definitely is it it's more like my weakness. Sometimes I'm too focused on uh how to do the storytelling or the solution but but sometime I drop out for the for the business part definitely a good point and and about my team and uh definitely actually I'm doing this kind of thing. So um just like I think yesterday we have talked about how to find teammates So it's more like friend or like multi multiple years uh of teammates. I verify their capabilities. We have some kind of bonding. So um what my on my team is right now uh mostly from this gusto or uh this gusto collective uh company but to be very honest the the company is uh is very uh very dangerous right now do not have much uh business but I think the people is really brilliant. So we have some um a UIUS design designer which is from the uh instruments company which is EXA with a lots of experience more than like 12 to 13 years and also one of my teammate to do the VR projects and also I find the people which is um my my previous colleague work on unity so uh he moved on to a uh government projects to work on the large scale uh um the city city level of uh uh we project so he's also very talented and also I have a a free 3D designers were uh he is a 3D artist that worked for the previous um the warrior future the the the the movie of the the the the CG artist. So he's one
previous um the warrior future the the the the movie of the the the the CG artist. So he's one of them. So I think definitely I'm uh brainstorming the idea with them and that's why I I really want to talk with Alex at least gain some traction how to improve it and then I tell my teammates oh uh how can we make it better? So so this is what I really trying to do.
Yeah. So the last thing is about the story the older the the story older why why I say the first part you're talking about who are you why you okay
but to be honest uh because uh I if I were investor
I don't care about who you are
I only care about who you are after I know your project
right
so you you put the most important thing the last part that's the wrong Yeah,
wrong direction. The first part you need to talk about
what's your project, how to make money, how big the money it is,
and then who who I am.
Okay,
that's why what we can do.
Yeah,
that's why me why I can do this project instead of why you who you are because uh uh yeah, that's not good things people are doing.
Yeah.
So what I'm thinking that the general The general order is the kind is what's the panoint about the market?
Yeah.
How big is the panoint it is? We have a solution. What's a solution? What's your pricing? What's your go-to market strategy? What's your team? Why you? Ah, this is the final final conclusion.
Wow. Wow. That's
this is the general order because the people you you you shouldn't talk about things only you care about is instead of you if the first thing like yesterday uh I'm not sure if you remember what the first thing when I introduce myself I I only just use one minutes because I know no one cares about me
yeah no one cares about me only if I talk about this but in yesterday that's presentation why I put my introd intro my introduction first is because uh you're listen to me yeah so I you must to know me otherwise you cannot buy in my story.
This is the first thing.
But when I talking to the investor like say if you're buying an iPhone or something you care about the iPhone you don't care about the April team right
so you want to tell me what's the benefit for iPhone how what can I do when I buy of iPhone what will benefit with me and I say oh so this is made by a team called Apon. Oh
so you want to tell me what's the benefit for iPhone how what can I do when I buy of iPhone what will benefit with me and I say oh so this is made by a team called Apon. Oh that that's good that they're pretty good great good project. So after strong confidence with buying this product then I buy this this is what are people thinking. So yeah you you need to change your view instead of you you need to change what you care about things.
Okay good right right yeah I thank you so much Alex for all the very valuable uh comment and when really straightforward because some sometimes when when people talk about it maybe they they be nice and things but I I think it's a really honest tell you the truth. Yeah.
Yeah. So so I I really appreciate and and also it I'm really sorry we spend quite a lot of time but but definitely I think it's very valuable. I will definitely take your uh opinion and comment and back to the team and I really will try to uh fix the uh the poweroint or or the business idea and all that stuff.
