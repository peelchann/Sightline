# 1) Executive Summary (High-confidence only)

- Treat “Why Hong Kong” as a strategic go-to-market decision: define **where your market is** and choose your beachhead accordingly. [Evidence: "how big is your market and where is your market"]
- For overseas founders, explicitly manage “unknown unknowns” (culture, pace, program fit); set expectations and pick the right ecosystem partners. [Evidence: "you don't know what you don't know"]
- Strong “Why Cyberport”: beyond money, it’s networks/mentors/investors and access to the right circles (government + partners). [Evidence: "cyberport is very powerful it has a lot of uh connections"]
- Use a **regulated-industry rationale** when applicable: pick jurisdictions with mature regulation to reduce friction (e.g., insurtech/healthtech). [Evidence: "insurance is a highly regulated"]
- Don’t overpromise milestones: reviewers prefer realistic, core-problem MVPs over “bells and whistles.” [Evidence: "didn't over project the number of features"]
- Practicing the pitch is a force multiplier: rehearse heavily to deliver smoothly under short time limits. [Evidence: "I probably rehearsed it maybe 50 times"]
- Do customer discovery before panel: pitch to many prospects so panel questions don’t surprise you. [Evidence: "present... with ten... potential customer"]
- Build a “data room / agile deck” early; repeated applications get faster when you have reusable materials ready. [Evidence: "you should have that pretty agile deck in your data room"]
- Don’t be discouraged by rejection: re-apply with improvements; some teams succeed in later rounds. [Evidence: "not successful... first attempt... got in... second round"]
- Use AI to prepare for vetting by generating “hardest judge questions” and rehearsing answers. [Evidence: "getting AI to think of... hardest questions"]

Use this section to check transcript statements for consistency.

# 3) Winning Patterns from Successful Cases (from the meeting)

## 3.1 Storytelling / framing tactics

- Anchor your narrative in market reality: “your country is not the world” → specify which region benefits most and why. [Evidence: "your country is not the world"]
- Tell a crisp “Why Hong Kong” story linked to market structure (e.g., APAC demand, logistics hub, regulated sectors). [Evidence: "Hong Kong actually has very very very healthy and mature"]
- Emphasize team-over-hero framing: it’s “11 players,” not one person; treat Cyberport ecosystem as extended team. [Evidence: "Your team is going to win for you, not one person"]
- Use a practical mindset shift: choose programs intentionally because “not all program are created equal.” [Evidence: "not all program are created equal"]

## 3.2 What evaluators reward (mapped to weighting)

- Business viability: show a credible business model and path to revenue, especially where procurement/regulation slows revenue. [Evidence: "go to market strategy... one of the most important things"]
- Team capability: highlight technical + business skills needed to execute safely (especially in regulated domains). [Evidence: "technical and business skills to execute"]
- Achievable milestones: show core MVP value, avoid over-scoping features; avoid “pie in the sky numbers.” [Evidence: "don't feel like you have to put... pie in the sky numbers"]

## 3.3 Presentation + Q&A tactics

- Practice at scale: rehearsal builds confidence and reduces “hiccups” in short presentations. [Evidence: "get your presentation through very very quickly"]
- Continuous pitching is training: every conference interaction is an “elevator pitch” → iterate fast. [Evidence: "every single new person that you meet, it's a pitch"]
- Keep your authentic delivery style; don’t “coach everyone into the same pitch.” [Evidence: "everybody deliver the pitch exactly the same"]

## 3.4 Common failure modes / red flags

- Overbuilding features instead of delivering the core value proposition in an MVP. [Evidence: "solve the core problem... rather than... bells and whistles"]
- Unrealistic revenue/timelines in regulated industries (healthcare revenue can be slow; procurement cycles 6–12 months). [Evidence: "6 to 12 months before you even get a contract"]
- Under-practiced pitch leading to time loss and weak panel impression. [Evidence: "such a short amount of time"]

# 4) CCMF Criteria Mapping (turn insights into a scoring checklist)

## Project Management Team (30%)

### What to show
- Clear founder/operator capability (repeat startup experience can support execution credibility). [Evidence: "this is my fourth startup"]
- Ability to recruit and work with the right people; show the team as “players” with defined roles. [Evidence: "You need 11 players"]
- Learning agility and readiness to navigate unknown markets. [Evidence: "don't understand Asia... these are the unknowns"]

### How to evidence it
- Describe how you met cofounders and why they fit (events/networking/hackathons/family friend). [Evidence: "my co-founder is a family friend"]
- Demonstrate domain expertise and delivery competence with concrete proof artifacts (deck, milestones, MVP). [Evidence: "build a viable case"]

### Pitfalls
- Solo-founder risk without credible support bench. **[Uncertain]** (Implied via cofounder emphasis; not explicitly “don’t do solo”.) [Evidence: "finding a co-founder... one of the most important things"]

## Business Model & Time to Market (30%)

### What to show
- A specific go-to-market strategy and which markets you target first. [Evidence: "go to market strategy... which markets you're going to target"]
- Beachhead logic (why HK is the landing spot / expansion port). [Evidence: "Hong Kong was our first... overseas expansion"]
- Realistic milestones tied to company growth (market expansion, networks, revenue). [Evidence: "quantifiable and scalable milestone"]

### How to evidence it
- Share a clear funnel or channel strategy (example: webinar → coaching → consulting → partnership). [Evidence: "webinar... hook... coaching... consulting"]
- Show procurement reality in your sector and how you still land MVP value. [Evidence: "bare bones... user interface... value proposition"]

### Pitfalls
- “Move fast and break things” in safety-critical sectors (healthcare): highlight safety/regulatory compliance. [Evidence: "break the patient"]
- Over-scoping features instead of delivering an MVP usable by a real customer/user. [Evidence: "minimal viable product... used by... doctors"]

## Creativity & Innovation (30%)

### What to show
- Explain the innovation in terms of outcomes (time saved, reduced errors, scalability) rather than novelty. [Evidence: "save up to about 70%"]
- Show differentiated capability beyond baseline tools (e.g., not “just an AI scribe”). [Evidence: "not simply just an AI scribe"]

### How to evidence it
- Use specific product claims and mechanism summaries (AI copilot nudges; context analysis; evidence-based responses). [Evidence: "nudges me and tells me what I forgot"]
- Provide defensible roadmap and market-fit reasoning; show why HK helps your regulatory or industry path. [Evidence: "Hong Kong actually make it very easy"]

### Pitfalls
- Vague “AI is cool” narrative without clear product proof and user value. [Evidence: "go to market strategy... most important"]

## Social Responsibility (10%)

### What to show
- Tie your project to concrete societal outcomes (e.g., reducing wait times / health system strain). [Evidence: "patients can wait for up to... 4 hours"]

### How to evidence it
- Present measurable impact metrics aligned to milestones (time saved, safety net, reduced delayed diagnosis). [Evidence: "reduce the misdiagnoses and delayed diagnosis"]

### Pitfalls
- Overclaiming short-term impact where sector cycles are long; keep it realistic. [Evidence: "takes a very long time"]

# 5) CCMF Answer Seeds (copy-ready snippets)

> Short bullets you can paste into application answers. Each bullet includes either **[Evidence]** or **[Uncertain]**.

## Problem
- Regulated sectors face slow procurement + high operational burden; without better tools, outcomes suffer (e.g., long waits, delayed treatment). [Evidence: "patients can wait for up to... 4 hours"]
- Existing workflows underuse available data, leading to delayed treatment and system strain. [Evidence: "we have the data... we're just not using that data"]

## Target users & payer
- **Users:** Frontline professionals using the workflow (e.g., doctors). [Evidence: "able to be used by... doctors"]
- **Payers:** Institutions/enterprises purchasing B2B solutions (private hospitals/clinics/EHR providers). [Evidence: "B2B partnerships with private hospitals, clinics"]

## Solution / product scope
- Build an MVP that proves the core value with a minimal UI and real user workflow fit. [Evidence: "bare bones... user interface... value proposition"]
- Provide an AI assistant that reduces admin burden and improves safety by surfacing missed steps. [Evidence: "save up to about 70%... administration time"]

## Innovation “why now”
- GenAI enables contextual analysis at scale (not possible before) to nudge clinicians and improve quality. [Evidence: "something that we've never been able to do before... at scale"]

## Go-to-market (first 90 days + 6 months)
- Focus GTM: pick the first region/segment intentionally; HK can be a strategic landing spot to bridge regions and build trust. [Evidence: "Hong Kong... landing spot"]
- Use partnerships and channel strategies that fit long procurement cycles (B2B partners, EHR providers). [Evidence: "procurement cycles... takes a very long time"]

## Milestones (month-by-month for 6 months)
- Month 1: Define target market + beachhead; validate “where is your market” with discovery. [Evidence: "how big is your market and where is your market"]
- Month 2: MVP build focused on core problem; avoid over-scoping features. [Evidence: "didn't... over project... features"]
- Month 3: Pilot-ready MVP + early B2B partner conversations (expect long cycles). [Evidence: "6 to 12 months before you even get a contract"]
- Month 4: Compliance / regulatory pathway discovery for target regions. [Evidence: "regulatory burden... constantly changing"]
- Month 5: Expand pipeline via repeatable funnel (webinars/events) and refine pitch. [Evidence: "every single new person... it's a pitch"]
- Month 6: Demonstrate measurable outcomes (time saved / safety net) + produce reporting artifacts. [Evidence: "save up to about 70%"]

## Budget buckets
- **[Uncertain]** Product development (MVP build), compliance/regulatory work, customer discovery & pilot activities, and go-to-market (events/travel). [Evidence: "conferences around Southeast Asia... rebates for up to 75%"]

## Social responsibility angle
- Healthcare impact: reduce strain on health systems by improving triage/efficiency and reducing delayed diagnosis. [Evidence: "delayed treatment for critical conditions"]

# 6) Action Items + RAID

## Actions
- **Owner:** Founder; **Due:** before vetting; **Next step:** practice pitch repeatedly until smooth; reduce hiccups. [Evidence: "rehearsed it maybe 50 times"]
- **Owner:** Founder; **Due:** before submission; **Next step:** finalize market + beachhead logic and GTM plan. [Evidence: "where is your market"]
- **Owner:** Founder; **Due:** before vetting; **Next step:** generate “hardest judge questions” using AI and rehearse responses. [Evidence: "got AI to think of... hardest questions"]
- **Owner:** Founder; **Due:** ongoing; **Next step:** keep attending events to build top-of-funnel and meet cofounders/partners. [Evidence: "attend as many events as you can"]

## RAID

### Risks
- **R1 (High):** Long procurement cycles delay revenue in regulated sectors; milestones must reflect realistic timelines. [Evidence: "6 to 12 months before you even get a contract"]
- **R2 (High):** Regulatory approvals can block market entry; rules change and require ongoing adaptation. [Evidence: "regulatory burden... constantly changing"]
- **R3 (Medium):** Pitch time constraints increase error risk; insufficient rehearsal leads to poor delivery. [Evidence: "short amount of time"]

### Assumptions
- **A1 (Uncertain):** Cyberport/Cyberport-linked funding can materially accelerate trust-building and partnerships for overseas founders. [Evidence: "build trust... help... very big"]

### Issues
- **I1 (Medium):** Overbuilding features reduces probability of delivering MVP on time. [Evidence: "bells and whistles"]

### Dependencies
- **D1 (High):** Access to pilots depends on partnerships with institutions and/or EHR providers. [Evidence: "partnerships... private hospitals... EHR providers"]
- **D2 (Medium):** Execution depends on assembling the right team; cofounder fit is high-stakes. [Evidence: "finding a co-founder... biggest challenges"]

# 7) Glossary + Transcript Normalization Notes

- **Cyberport / Cyber board / cyborg / sideboard** → Cyberport (organization name). **Likely** (multiple garbled variants). [Evidence: "cyber port"]
- **CMF funds** → [Uncertain] could mean Cyberport Macro Fund / Cyberport investment fund; transcript: “CMF funds one of the investor”. **Uncertain.** [Evidence: "one of the CMF funds one of the investor"]
- **Series 8 / Series A** → likely Series A fundraising round. **Likely.** [Evidence: "finished our series a round"]
- **Javas MD** → product name (AI clinical co-pilot + AI scribe). **Confirmed.** [Evidence: "our first product is called Javas MD"]
- **SMD** → [Uncertain] transcript uses “SMD” near regulatory certification; likely “SaMD” (Software as a Medical Device). **Likely.** [Evidence: "class A software as a medical device... That's SMD"]
- **LM / LMS** → likely LLM / LLMs (large language model[s]). **Likely.** [Evidence: "using... LM to fine-tune"]
