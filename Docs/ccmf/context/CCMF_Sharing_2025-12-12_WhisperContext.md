# 1) Executive Summary (High-confidence only)

- Cyberport positions itself as more than funding: compute, networks, events, and industry resources; your application should show how you will *use the ecosystem*. [Evidence: "有 很 發 展 成 熟 的 一 些 不 同 的 網 絡"]
- CCMF is for early-stage digital-tech projects; grant is HK$100,000 over 6 months with milestone-based disbursement. [Evidence: "10 萬 塊 的…CCMF… 半 年 的 一 個 計 劃"]
- CCMF evaluates 4 dimensions: team capability, operating model/time-to-market, creativity/innovation, and social responsibility (~10%). [Evidence: "四 個…包括…團 隊…營 運…創 意…最 後 10%…社 會 責 任"]
- Applications are via EMS; use a frequently-checked email because communications/results come via that email. [Evidence: "用 一 個 電 流 去 登 錄…請 確 保…經 常…會 經 由 這 個"]
- Prepare English materials: application form and PPT must be in English; Q&A may allow other language, but English is recommended. [Evidence: "Application form…全 英 文… PPT…也 需 要 用 英 文"]
- CCMF/CIP vetting format is time-boxed; CCMF presentation is 6 minutes + 4 minutes Q&A; CIP Q&A is longer (8 minutes). [Evidence: "CCMF…六 分 鐘…四 分 鐘…CIP…六 分 鐘…八 分 鐘"]
- Winning pitch advice from case sharing: don’t “sell technology”; sell a solution + market problem + how you’ll win. [Evidence: "不 要 只 是 去 賣 的 technology…在 賣 的 solution"]
- You must explain “Why Hong Kong” and “Why Cyberport” as part of the narrative. [Evidence: "為 什 麼 要 去 講 香 港…為 什 麼 特 別 選"]
- Build a realistic roadmap (6/12/18 months) and set achievable KPIs; overly aggressive KPIs can backfire because they become review targets. [Evidence: "KPI…不 要 太 aggressive…會 拿…target…看 你 是 不 是 達 標"]
- Validate before pitching: talk to 10+ potential customers; their questions will mirror panel questions. [Evidence: "先 跟 十 個 以 上 的 potential customer 都 去 pitch 過"]
- Team formation advice: startups are trust-heavy; at least some core members should be known for 5+ years (10+ years cited). [Evidence: "認 識…超 過 五 年 以 上…認 識 了 10 年 以 上"]
- If you re-apply in a later intake after rejection, explain what changed vs last submission. [Evidence: "下 一 期…重 新…說…有 什 麼 分 別…改 進"]

# 2) Official CCMF Constraints (for cross-check)

Summarize ONLY the baseline constraints listed below (do not add new rules):

- **Vetting weighting:** Team 30%, Business Model & Time to Market 30% (product launch within 3 months from grant disbursement encouraged/preferred), Creativity & Innovation 30%, Social Responsibility 10%.
- **Grant:** HK$100,000 total; disbursed HK$10k on signing, HK$45k after interim report approval, HK$45k on completion + final report approval.
- **Implementation period:** 6 months; interim + final reports required.
- **Vetting stages commonly described:** initial screening → vetting → presentation + Q&A.

Use this section to check transcript statements for consistency.

# 3) Winning Patterns from Successful Cases (from the meeting)

## 3.1 Storytelling / framing tactics

- Lead with the customer problem + solution, not “cool tech”; frame as a product/solution pitch. [Evidence: "不 要 只 是 去 賣 的 technology…在 賣 的 solution"]
- Explain “Why Hong Kong” (strategic reasons for landing and scaling) rather than treating location as incidental. [Evidence: "為 什 麼 特 別 選 擇 香 港…原 因"]
- Make Cyberport credibility part of the story: it helps “build trust” quickly in HK for teams without local background. [Evidence: "很 快 的 bild trust…數 馬 港…幫 助 真 的 很 大"]
- Show you would proceed even without the grant; funding accelerates, not enables. [Evidence: "就 算 沒 有 這 個…我 們…還 是 會 繼 續 下 去"]

## 3.2 What evaluators reward (mapped to weighting)

- They reward teams that articulate a clear market problem + credible solution (not only tech details). [Evidence: "在 解 決 的 是…多 大 的…問 題"]
- They reward “Why Hong Kong / Why Cyberport” rationale. [Evidence: "這 個 東 西…非 常 重 要"]
- They reward clear roadmaps with achievable milestones and KPIs. [Evidence: "很 清 晰 的 一 個 roadmap…一 定 要…chievable"]
- They reward demonstrated team capability (especially where the plan requires specialized execution). [Evidence: "展 示…strong 的 team…讓 評 委…有 信 心"]
- They reward sustainability as a core criterion (survive after funding). [Evidence: "兩 年 後…能 不 能 生 存 下 去…很 重 要"]

## 3.3 Presentation + Q&A tactics

- Time discipline is non-negotiable; overly long decks reduce scoring because panel cannot hear the full case. [Evidence: "timing…很 準 確…根 本…沒 有 足 夠 的 信 息 來 評 分"]
- Prepare by pitching to 10+ potential customers; you’ll collect objections and Q&A in advance. [Evidence: "十 個 以 上…pitch…他 們 就 會 問 你 的 問 題"]
- Anticipate common questions (market/business model/team/execution); many judges’ questions are similar across competitions. [Evidence: "評 委 們 問 的 東 西…也 差 不 多"]
- If allowed, having two presenters can help under pressure; transcript shows uncertainty about whether 2 are permitted. **[Uncertain]** [Evidence: "如 果…兩 個 人…最 好…我 不 太 肯 定"]

## 3.4 Common failure modes / red flags

- “Tech demo only” without a solution/market narrative. [Evidence: "不 要 只 是…technology…在 賣…solution"]
- Overly aggressive, unrealistic KPIs (judges can tell; becomes a liability during reviews). [Evidence: "KPI 得 太 高…評 委…一 看…都 知 道"]
- Overlong decks that violate strict timing. [Evidence: "PPT 做 的 太 長…超 值…時 間 上 不 夠"]
- Treating application as paperwork rather than an “investment-style” persuasion (market size + execution credibility). [Evidence: "你 不 要 把 當 做 application…當 做…investor"]

# 4) CCMF Criteria Mapping (turn insights into a scoring checklist)

## Project Management Team (30%)

**What to show**
- Clear team roles and why this team can execute the plan. [Evidence: "展 示…strong 的 team…有 信 心"]
- Trust and stability of the core team (how long you’ve worked together). [Evidence: "認 識…超 過 五 年…10 年 以 上"]
- Learning agility (ability to adapt rapidly as market/policy changes). [Evidence: "學 習…非 常 重 要…政 策…馬 上…變 了"]

**How to evidence it**
- Provide execution proof: track record, domain expertise, and relevant prior wins (case speaker emphasizes credibility building). [Evidence: "credibility…build trust"]
- Show you have or can access a support network (mentors, manager, ecosystem). [Evidence: "配 一 個…導 師…導 師 給 你 們"]

**Pitfalls**
- One-person team with no credible support (Cyberport also asks for core team members; only listed core members can present). [Evidence: "填 寫…核 心 團 隊 成 員…才 能…presentation"]
- Team can’t demonstrate learning/adaptation speed. [Evidence: "能 夠 多 快 的 反 應…決 定"]

## Business Model & Time to Market (30%)

**What to show**
- A concrete operating model and how you will reach the market. [Evidence: "go to market 的 strategy…非 常 重 要"]
- Roadmap milestones (6/12/18 months) with clear deliverables. [Evidence: "六 個 月…12 個 月…18 個 月…R map"]
- A market sizing view (TAM) and why the segment is big enough. [Evidence: "規 劃…TAM…多 大"]

**How to evidence it**
- Describe your acquisition channel(s) (case: webinars → coaching → consulting → conversion). [Evidence: "webinar 去 hook…再…consulting"]
- Bring early leads or validation (case: “customer lead” existed pre-application). **[Uncertain]** [Evidence: "已 經 有 一 些 customer lead"]
- Keep KPIs achievable and defensible (they become review targets). [Evidence: "會 拿…KPI…看…達 標"]

**Pitfalls**
- No GTM path beyond “build it and hope.” [Evidence: "go to market…非 常 重 要"]
- Over-claiming KPIs to impress reviewers (backfires). [Evidence: "不 要 太 aggressive"]

## Creativity & Innovation (30%)

**What to show**
- Innovation framed as solving a real market problem, not novelty for novelty’s sake. [Evidence: "在 解 決 的 是…問 題"]
- Clear differentiation and why your approach works better. [Evidence: "方 案…能 夠…prove"]

**How to evidence it**
- Use the “solution not tech” framing: show how tech enables the solution. [Evidence: "不 要…賣…technology…賣…solution"]
- Use Cyberport resources where relevant (AI compute, partner networks). [Evidence: "AI 的 computing power…非 常 有 競 爭 力"]

**Pitfalls**
- Over-indexing on technology explanation without linking to customer value. [Evidence: "不 要 只 是…technology"]

## Social Responsibility (10%)

**What to show**
- Explicit social responsibility outcomes relevant to HK (education, accessibility, inclusion, etc.). **[Uncertain]** (Transcript states SR is 10% but does not provide examples.) [Evidence: "最 後 10%…社 會 責 任"]

**How to evidence it**
- Define measurable outcomes and tie them to milestones/KPIs. [Evidence: "KPI…會 拿…看…達 標"]

**Pitfalls**
- Treat SR as generic “nice-to-have” with no measurable outcomes. **[Uncertain]** [Evidence: "最 後 10%…社 會 責 任"]

# 5) CCMF Answer Seeds (copy-ready snippets)

> Short bullets you can paste into answers. Each bullet includes either **[Evidence]** or **[Uncertain]**.

## Problem
- Many projects fail because they describe technology, not a real, valuable market problem; frame the pain clearly and quantify it. [Evidence: "在 解 決 的 是…多 大 的…問 題"]

## Target users & payer
- Payer/user clarity must match the solution you are “selling” (solution framing). **[Uncertain]** (This transcript emphasizes selling solution, not specific payer types.) [Evidence: "在 賣 的 solution"]

## Solution / product scope
- Describe a concrete solution, not just tech; explain how your tech solves the market pain. [Evidence: "不 要…賣…technology…賣…solution"]

## Innovation “why now”
- Emphasize why your approach is timely and feasible now (e.g., AI compute availability and ecosystem support). [Evidence: "AI 的 computing power…競 爭 力"]

## Go-to-market (first 90 days + 6 months)
- Define a repeatable GTM path (example: webinar funnel), not ad-hoc outreach. [Evidence: "webinar 去 hook…再…consulting"]
- Use early customer conversations (10+ pitches) to refine objections and improve Q&A readiness. [Evidence: "十 個 以 上…pitch"]

## Milestones (month-by-month for 6 months)
- Month 1: Establish baseline MVP plan + validate with customer pitches (≥10). [Evidence: "十 個 以 上…pitch"]
- Month 2: Build MVP and define achievable KPIs tied to deliverables. [Evidence: "KPI…不 要 太 aggressive"]
- Month 3: Interim milestone review readiness (milestone-based funding implies preset targets). [Evidence: "第 三 個 月…中 期…preset…目 標"]
- Month 4: Iterate based on market feedback; adapt quickly to changes. [Evidence: "政 策…馬 上…變 了"]
- Month 5: Prepare for final deliverables and reporting; refine deck timing and Q&A answers. [Evidence: "timing…很 準 確"]
- Month 6: Completion + final review readiness; ensure KPIs met and outputs documented. [Evidence: "第 六 個 月…項 目 完 成…評 估"]

## Budget buckets
- Placeholder: equipment, software development, and execution costs aligned to deliverables. **[Uncertain]** (Transcript mentions “equipment” and “software development” generically.) [Evidence: "purchase…equipment… software development"]

## Social responsibility angle
- Explicitly state social responsibility outcomes and measurement, since SR contributes 10% to scoring. [Evidence: "最 後 10%…社 會 責 任"]

# 6) Action Items + RAID

## Actions

- **Owner:** Applicant / team lead; **Due:** before the deadline; **Next step:** submit via EMS, ensure all files are ready before deadline because post-deadline edits aren’t allowed. [Evidence: "dadline…1 月 2 號…不 可 以 改"]
- **Owner:** Applicant; **Due:** before submission; **Next step:** write application + PPT in English. [Evidence: "Application form…全 英 文… PPT…英 文"]
- **Owner:** Applicant; **Due:** before vetting; **Next step:** compress presentation to fit 6 minutes and practice strict timing. [Evidence: "六 分 鐘…要 抓 緊…時 間"]
- **Owner:** Applicant; **Due:** before vetting; **Next step:** talk to 10+ potential customers and collect objections. [Evidence: "十 個 以 上…potential customer"]
- **Owner:** Applicant; **Due:** if reapplying; **Next step:** document changes vs prior submission (what improved). [Evidence: "下 一 期…說…分 別…改 進"]

## RAID

**Risks**
- **R1 (High):** Overlong deck → panel cannot score full case due to strict timing. [Evidence: "沒 有 足 夠 的 信 息 來 評 分"]
- **R2 (High):** “Tech-only” pitch → weak scoring because reviewers are buying a solution. [Evidence: "不 要…賣…technology…賣…solution"]
- **R3 (Medium):** KPIs too aggressive → reviewers see it as unrealistic and it becomes a liability in reviews. [Evidence: "KPI 得 太 高…一 看…都 知 道"]
- **R4 (Medium):** Team trust/stability not evidenced → reduces confidence. [Evidence: "認 識…超 過 五 年"]

**Assumptions**
- **A1 (Uncertain):** Applicant has early leads (customer leads) similar to the case speaker; otherwise roadmap credibility may be harder to justify. **[Uncertain]** [Evidence: "已 經 有 一 些 customer lead"]

**Issues**
- **I1 (High):** Post-deadline edits not allowed; late prep risks irreversible submission errors. [Evidence: "過 了…dadline…不 可 以 改"]

**Dependencies**
- **D1 (Medium):** Access to Cyberport resources (manager, networks, compute) requires active engagement and eligibility. [Evidence: "c manager…bridge…資 源"]

# 7) Glossary + Transcript Normalization Notes

- **CCMF**: Cyberport Creative Micro Fund. **Confirmed**. [Evidence: "創 意…資 金 CCMM"]

- **MDSS**: Market Development Support Scheme. **Confirmed**. [Evidence: "MDSS…海 外 及 內 市 場"]
- **DELF / DF**: Digital Entertainment Leadership Forum. **Likely** (transcript says “DF…digital Entertainment Leadership Forum”). [Evidence: "DF…digital Entertainment Leadership Forum"]
- **EMS portal**: Cyberport application system. **Confirmed**. [Evidence: "EMS…portal"]

- **“Global source(s)”**: Trade show / event (“Global Sources”). **Likely**. [Evidence: "global source 參 加 展"]

# 8) Open Questions for Me (max 12)

1. What is the exact event name you want in the `source:` field (e.g., “Cyberport Launchpad1” or a formal title)?  
2. Do you want this context pack to focus on **CCMF only**, or CCMF + CIP together?  
3. Which parts of the transcript are incomplete/garbled in your original file—do you have the full transcript with line numbers?  
4. For your own CCMF application, what is your **target launch within 3 months** after grant disbursement (as encouraged by the programme)?  
5. What 3–5 KPIs do you want to commit to (keeping them achievable as warned in the session)?  
6. Which Cyberport ecosystem resources are most relevant to your project (AI compute, events, partner network, mentor matching)?  
7. What is your plan to demonstrate **team stability** (how long core members have worked together)?  
8. What are your top 10 potential customers you can pitch before vetting (to follow the “10+ pitches” advice)?  
9. Do you plan to submit both CCMF and CIP in the same intake (allowed, but only one may be held)?  
10. What is your plan to ensure a strict 6-minute deck (structure + rehearsal cadence)?  
11. How will you evidence social responsibility (10%) with measurable outcomes?  
12. Do you want me to cross-check this transcript against your existing repo docs (`Docs/CCMF_DAY1_CONTEXT.md`, etc.) and flag any inconsistencies?
