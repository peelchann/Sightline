## Skill Gaps & Mitigation Strategies

### Gap 1: Limited UX/UI Design Experience
**Impact:** AR card design may lack polish  
**Mitigation:** 
- Hire freelance UX designer (budgeted HK$4K)
- Study competitor apps (Google Lens, Niantic Lightship demos)
- Iterate based on teacher trial feedback (Month 3)

### Gap 2: No Full-Time Unity XR Specialist
**Impact:** Quest 3 implementation may face delays  
**Mitigation:**
- Hire part-time contractor with proven AR Foundation experience
- Build phone outdoor demo first (de-risks core functionality)
- Meta's Passthrough Camera API samples provide working code to adapt

### Gap 3: Limited Video Production Experience
**Impact:** Demo video may not be professional quality  
**Mitigation:**
- Contract local videographer (budgeted HK$6K)
- Study CCMF showcase videos from previous years
- Prepare shot list and script in advance

### Gap 4: No Prior Museum Partnership Experience
**Impact:** May struggle to secure pilot LOI  
**Mitigation:**
- Start outreach early (Week 5, after demo ready)
- Leverage advisor connections (if available)
- Offer free pilot with no strings attached
- Target smaller venues first (PMQ, community museums) before major institutions
