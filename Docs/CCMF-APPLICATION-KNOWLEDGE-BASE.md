### 3.2 Abstract (English)

> **Word Count:** 299/300

Sightline is an AI-native Augmented Reality (AR) platform that turns static venue information (labels, wall text and linear audio guides) into dynamic, personalized "on-object answers" anchored to exhibits.

In schools, museum and cultural venues, information is one-size-fits-all and disconnected from visitors' level of understanding and preference. Users disengage, switch to phone searches, and lose focus. For operators, digital upgrades are often expensive one-off projects that are slow to update, hard to reuse across exhibitions, and provide limited engagement analytics.

Sightline delivers a repeatable B2B SaaS "Exhibition Engine" comprising:
1. A headless CMS for curators/teachers to upload approved knowledge, set response rules, and publish updates instantly
2. An AI experience orchestrator
3. An analytics dashboard

**Core Loop:** See → anchor → personalise → overlay

Visitors point at an exhibit and receive a concise AR card anchored to the object. Experience starts with lightweight onboarding to set language, interest selection and subject level (e.g., secondary vs university). Sightline then suggests level-appropriate information and questions to tap (with optional typing) and learns preferences over time to improve recommendations.

To ensure institutional trust, responses are grounded in venue-approved sources via retrieval (RAG), constrained to approved scopes, and designed to refuse or fall back when confidence is low; staff can review sources and refine content based on clustered questions.

Hardware-agnostic by design, Sightline launches with zero-install mobile WebAR and supports hands-free indoor pilots and later stages will be using mixed-reality headsets using visual anchors. The commercial model targets school or institutional budgets with a one-time onboarding/setup fee plus annual SaaS licensing for CMS, updates and analytics.

**CCMF 6-month deliverables:**
- Stable MVP
- CMS v0
- Analytics v1 (TTFV, anchor lock success, dwell time and Q&A volume)
- Bilingual UX
- Two pilots (one indoor heritage route and one indoor education space)

### 3.3 Abstract (Chinese)

> **Word Count:** 394/500

眼前百科是一個人工智能原生的擴增實境平台，願景是成為現實世界的知識層，把展品標籤、牆身文字與線性導覽，轉為可即時更新、因人而異、貼附實物的資訊卡，讓觀眾不離開展品視線亦能理解與延伸探索。

現時場館內容一體適用，忽略興趣、程度與偏好，觀眾被迫改用手機搜尋而分心。營運方亦常以昂貴的一次性數碼專案推進，更新慢、難重用、缺乏數據佐證。視線的使命是提供可重複部署的企業對企業軟件即服務平台。策展人與教師用內容管理系統上載核准資料並設定回應規則。系統先作簡短入門設定語言與程度，再提供合適層級的建議問題供點選或輸入，並按互動行為逐步學習；同時輸出停留時間、互動與常見提問分析以支援內容迭代。為確保可信度，回應以場館核准資料檢索為先，信心不足則保守回覆或拒答。

定位上，視線不是一次性擴增實境專案，而是可快速落地的智能內容平台，先以免安裝網頁體驗進入市場，後續支援室內免手持頭戴式體驗；六個月內交付最小可行產品、內容平台、分析儀表板與兩個試點，並以量化成效推動續約與擴展。

## 6. Creativity & Innovation

> **Vetting Weighting: 30%**

### 6.1 Core Innovation

Sightline is an AI-native augmented reality platform that disrupts the static, one-size-fits-all nature of learning and interpretation in physical spaces.

**Innovation:** A mobile-first spatial learning loop—**See → Anchor → Personalise → Overlay**—that turns real-world objects into interactive learning interfaces, delivering level-appropriate explanations without users leaving the exhibit to search the web.

### 6.2 Four Innovation Pillars

#### 1. Disruptive Experience Design for Hong Kong's Real Conditions

**Problem with current solutions:** Worksheets, wall text, linear audio, or basic AR overlays are predetermined and do not adapt to learner needs.

**Sightline's Innovation:** Personalisation-first interaction model designed for compact, noisy environments:
- Lightweight onboarding to set language, interest lens, and subject level (e.g., junior secondary vs tertiary)
- Guided question prompts for tap-to-ask (with optional typing)
- Progressive preference learning
- "YouTube-like" relevance without the distraction of switching apps or tabs

#### 2. AI-Native Content Engine with Institution-Grade Integrity

**Key Differentiator:** Not a generic chatbot

Sightline's AI is built to be trusted in education and cultural settings:
- Responses grounded in teacher/curator-approved content via retrieval (RAG)
- Bounded by defined scopes and formatting rules
- Designed to refuse or fall back when confidence is low
- Converts AI from an open-ended chatbot into a **governed learning tool** that schools can safely adopt

#### 3. Repeatable Platform, Not a One-Off AR Project

**Innovation:** Productising what is typically a bespoke AR build into a repeatable B2B SaaS "Exhibition Engine"

**Benefits:**
- Reduces deployment time from months to weeks
- Enables instant content updates without code changes
- Supports repeat deployments across classrooms, labs, and school learning trails

#### 4. Measurable Innovation Outcomes

**Within 3–6 months, demonstrate measurable KPIs that traditional methods cannot provide:**
- Time-to-first-value
- Anchor success/stability
- Dwell time uplift
- Interaction volume
- Clustered "confusion points" that directly inform lesson improvement

**Result:** A closed-loop system where usage data improves content quality and learning outcomes over time.
