## Outreach Email Template (to accompany LOI)

**Subject:** Pilot Partnership Opportunity - AR Heritage Education (Cyberport CCMF-Funded)

---

Dear [Contact Person Name],

My name is [Your Name], and I'm the founder of Sightline, an AR heritage education platform designed to increase student engagement at Hong Kong's cultural sites.

I'm reaching out to invite [Museum/School Name] to participate in a **free 3-month pilot** (Sep–Nov 2026) as part of our Cyberport CCMF-funded project.

**What is Sightline?**
- Students point their phone at a landmark (e.g., Clock Tower) → AR information card appears in <2 seconds, anchored to the building
- Zero setup, works indoors + outdoors
- Free for all HK schools

**Why [Museum/School Name]?**
- [Personalize: e.g., "Your museum's focus on early HK history aligns perfectly with our POI content" OR "Your school's emphasis on experiential learning makes this a great fit"]

**What We're Asking:**
- 2-3 on-site testing days (1-2 hours each)
- 1 curator/teacher to review POI content
- Optional: Share anonymized visitor/student data (to measure impact)

**What You Get:**
- Free AR layer for your venue/students (HK$10K-15K value)
- Increased engagement (we're targeting 20-30% dwell time increase)
- Case study for your marketing ("First museum in HK to use hybrid AR anchoring")

I've attached:
1. **Pilot Letter of Intent (LOI)** - draft terms
2. **Sightline One-Pager** - project overview
3. **Demo Video** (90 seconds) - [Link: YouTube/Google Drive]

Would you be open to a **20-minute call** to discuss? I'm available [suggest 2-3 time slots].

Thank you for considering this partnership. I believe Sightline can make a meaningful difference in how [museum visitors / students] experience Hong Kong's heritage.

Best regards,

## Follow-Up Email Template (1 week after initial outreach)

**Subject:** Re: Pilot Partnership Opportunity - AR Heritage Education

---

Dear [Contact Person Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from [date] about the Sightline AR pilot partnership.

I understand you're busy, so I'll keep this brief:

**Quick Recap:**
- Free 3-month AR pilot at [Museum/School Name] (Sep–Nov 2026)
- Increase visitor/student engagement (targeting 20-30% dwell time increase)
- Cyberport CCMF-funded (HK$100K grant)

**Next Step:**
If interested, let's schedule a 20-min call to discuss:
1. Which galleries/routes would benefit most from AR
2. Timeline for content review (curator/teacher approval)
3. Any questions about privacy, data, or technical setup

I'm available [suggest 2-3 new time slots].

If now isn't the right time, no worries—I'd be happy to reconnect in [3 months / after summer / etc.].

Thank you again for considering this.

Best,

**[Your Name]**  
[Your Email] | [Your Phone]

**P.S.** If you'd prefer a quick intro call first (no commitment), I'm happy to do a 10-min Zoom just to show the demo and answer questions.

## Tips for Securing LOI

### Do's:
✅ Personalize each outreach (mention specific gallery, school program, etc.)  
✅ Lead with "free" and "no cost" (removes budget objection)  
✅ Include demo video link (visual proof is powerful)  
✅ Offer flexibility ("You choose which galleries/routes")  
✅ Follow up 1 week after initial email (80% of deals happen after 5+ touchpoints)  
✅ Be patient (museums/schools move slowly, may take 2-4 weeks for response)

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't oversell ("revolutionary," "game-changing")—be modest  
❌ Don't ask for money upfront (this is a pilot, not a sale)  
❌ Don't send generic mass emails (personalization matters)  
❌ Don't follow up more than 3 times (after 3 follow-ups, move on)  
❌ Don't promise features not yet built (stick to what Month 5 MVP can deliver)

## Alternative: School LOI (If Museum Proves Difficult)

**Rationale:** Schools are often easier to secure than museums (less bureaucracy, teachers are decision-makers).

**Strategy:**
- Target schools with strong Liberal Studies / History departments
- Reach out to teacher networks (EdCity, HKEdBlog)
- Offer to present at school staff meeting (10 min, show demo)
- Leverage CCMF connection ("Cyberport-funded project")

**Pros:**
- Faster approval cycle (2-3 weeks vs. 4-6 weeks for museums)
- Teachers are early adopters (more willing to try new tech)
- Free tier for schools is permanent (vs. museum pilot ends after 3 months)

**Cons:**
- Smaller scale (50-100 students vs. 500-1,000 museum visitors)
- Less impressive for CIP application (museums carry more weight)

---

**Document Status:** Ready for customization and outreach  
**Next Action:** Send 10 personalized emails in Month 5 (after demo video ready)  
**Target:** 1 signed LOI by end of Month 6 for CCMF Final Report
