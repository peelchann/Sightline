# CCMF → Gamma Slide Creation Guide (Sightline)

**Purpose:** This document is the **operating guide** for turning Sightline CCMF materials into a **single, consistent Gamma prompt** that generates a **13-slide deck** aligned to CCMF scoring logic and advisor feedback.  
**Use case:** You will follow this guide later when you paste the remaining batches (Alex + Cyberport + Matthew + SEN teacher), and then generate the final Traditional Chinese Gamma prompt.

---

## 1) How you should deliver materials (recommended: 6 batches, fixed order)

Your multi-step input approach is workable. The key is to package each batch in a consistent format so we can distinguish:
- **Facts** (already committed in CCMF form)
- **Decisions** (confirmed direction)
- **Recommendations** (advisor guidance)
- **Hypotheticals** (ideas/templates not yet confirmed)

This prevents contradictions between the final deck and the CCMF form.

### Batch 1: Lucas comments and direction
Already provided.

**Two critical missing items to supply (still needed):**
- Which **specific demo clip** Lucas wants you to lead with:
  - **file name/link**
  - the **one sentence** the clip should prove
- Whether you have **officially decided** to adopt **“education-first”** as Stage 1

### Batch 2: Alex (RLX) critique and instructions
Please paste Alex’s comments as either:
- raw text, or
- structured notes,

but keep these kinds of statements intact:
- “remove this”
- “reframe that”
- “don’t claim X”
- “must include Y”

This is necessary to resolve conflicts with Lucas and CCMF scoring logic.

### Batch 3: Cyberport sharing-session notes (two sessions)
Paste the content in **four parts**:
1. **Scoring focus and evaluation criteria**
2. **Typical failure reasons / red flags**
3. **“Must answer” items**
4. **Recommended pitch structure and time control**

This batch is essential because it provides judge heuristics.

### Batch 4: Your latest CCMF application answers (authoritative source of truth)
You already pasted most of it.

If **4.6 / 4.7 / 4.8** are unfinished, please include the latest draft.

**Rule:** In the final deck, all numeric claims, milestones, target segment, deliverables, and budget uses **must match Batch 4**.

### Batch 5: Technical feasibility scope for 6 months (Matthew’s view)
Please structure it as:
- **Must do**
- **Nice-to-have**
- **Not doing**

This prevents the most common deck failure: over-promising within the CCMF period.

### Batch 6: STEM teacher input (SEN angle)
Share:
- teacher’s concrete needs
- classroom scenarios
- procurement considerations
- privacy/adoption concerns

This strengthens: **Problem**, **Social responsibility**, **Personalisation differentiation**, and **pilot design**.

---

## 2) Conflict reconciliation rules (so the deck stays consistent)

Goal: maximise CCMF approval probability while keeping the deck internally consistent and aligned with the CCMF form.

### 2.1 Prioritisation hierarchy when inputs conflict
1. **First priority:** Formal commitments already written in your CCMF form  
   (positioning, segment, milestones, deliverables, budget intent)
2. **Second priority:** Cyberport sharing-session scoring criteria and red flags
3. **Third priority:** Lucas and Alex guidance on deck structure and narrative discipline  
   (video first, scenario-based problem, 13 slides, AI-first framing, avoid technical overload)
4. **Fourth priority:** Matthew feasibility constraints (reduce scope, raise credibility)
5. **Fifth priority:** STEM teacher SEN input (reinforce personalisation, equity, pilot legitimacy)

### 2.2 Claim classification
Every claim must be tagged as one of:
- **Confirmed**: already in CCMF form (safe to state as fact)
- **Reasonable commitment**: deliverable within 6 months (commit cautiously + consistently)
- **Vision-only**: allowed late in deck (do not present as near-term promise)

---

## 3) Reduce the PDF deck (28 pages) to 13 pages

Your current deck likely has a workable backbone but is overloaded in the middle, especially around background and long-form explanations.

Lucas’s critique implies two non-negotiables:
- opening must be a **concrete situation/problem**
- deck must be **shorter** and more **scenario-driven**

Practical reduction method:
- compress background/track record into **one page** (at most two)
- shift narrative to **education/vocational first**
- position museums/venues as **stage 2**

---

## 4) 13-slide structure (mapped to CCMF scoring + Lucas guidance)

### Slide 1: Opening positioning + strongest proof
State in one sentence what Sightline is and why it matters, and explicitly indicate where the best demo clip sits. Make the viewer understand the “on-object answers anchored to real objects” experience within seconds.

### Slide 2: Scenario-based problem (Lucas’s top priority)
Use a Hong Kong school STEM/lab or vocational training scenario to show the current failure mode of static, one-size-fits-all content. Integrate SEN naturally as an equity and personalisation requirement, not as a side note.

### Slide 3: Institutional pain (why the buyer will pay)
Explain why one-off digital projects are expensive, slow to update, hard to reuse, and produce weak engagement analytics. Establish the need for a governed, measurable platform.

### Slide 4: Solution overview (AI-first, AR as interface)
Describe the See → Anchor → Personalise → Overlay loop and emphasise “tap-to-ask + guided prompts” to ensure reliability in real conditions.

### Slide 5: UX detail (so judges can picture real usage)
Describe onboarding, bilingual level settings, how the AR card looks, how prompts/questions work, and how preference-learning improves recommendations over time.

### Slide 6: Platform modules (CMS + Orchestrator + Analytics)
Explain the B2B SaaS “exhibition/on-object learning engine,” including content governance, RAG grounding, and measurable analytics.

### Slide 7: Trust and governance (education-grade AI)
Clarify it is not an open-ended chatbot. Show constrained scope, refusal/fallback, source visibility, and PDPO-aligned data minimisation principles.

### Slide 8: Market entry and expansion path
Commit to Stage 1: education/vocational labs. Stage 2: museums/galleries. Avoid “all verticals at once.”

### Slide 9: Business model
Explain onboarding/setup plus annual licensing, and how pilots convert into renewals through measurable outcomes. Keep pricing conservative unless you have real evidence.

### Slide 10: Go-to-market (6 months executable)
Describe outreach channels, school decision-makers, standardised onboarding playbook, and packaged modules that reduce adoption friction.

### Slide 11: 6-month milestones (most credibility-sensitive)
Month-by-month deliverables that exactly match your CCMF form: stable MVP, CMS v0, analytics v1, bilingual UX, two pilots, and reporting KPIs.

### Slide 12: Team execution credibility (compressed)
One page only. Keep Disney/award items as proof artifacts, not multi-page biography.

### Slide 13: Funding use and ask
Explain the HKD 100k allocation categories at a high level and restate the delivery commitment: launch in 3 months, prove impact by month 6, then scale.

## 5) Gamma prompt writing principles (high impact constraints)

A high-performing Gamma prompt is explicit about:
- role
- audience
- output format
- slide count
- language
- forbidden formatting
- per-slide requirements

For this project, enforce:
- **13 slides exactly**
- **Traditional Chinese** for the final deck
- Each slide includes:
  - a **title**
  - **2–4 paragraphs** of prose
  - a **“visual suggestion”** paragraph
- **No bullet points**
- Preserve **CCMF form commitments** as the authoritative baseline
- Resolve conflicts by prioritising feasibility and CCMF scoring fit

---

## 6) Gamma long prompt template (English explanation; actual deck prompt will be Traditional Chinese)

You requested the final Gamma input to be extremely detailed, letting Gamma handle concision. So the correct approach is:
- create a long, content-rich instruction
- lock the structure and constraints
- pre-write every slide as full paragraphs

After you paste Batch 2/3/5/6 inputs, we will produce the final filled prompt in Traditional Chinese where every slide is already written in full paragraphs and is consistent with your CCMF form language and commitments.

---

## 7) Next step (shortest path)

Do not restate background again. Proceed in this order using the wrapper format:
- Paste **Batch 2** (Alex critique) first
- Then **Batch 3** (Cyberport sessions)
- Then **Batch 5** (Matthew feasibility scope)
- Then **Batch 6** (STEM teacher SEN input)

Once those are provided, we will generate the final **Traditional Chinese Gamma prompt** consisting of **13 fully written slides** (no bullet points), aligned with:
- Lucas’s constraints
- Alex’s critique
- Cyberport scoring heuristics
- your latest CCMF form commitments
