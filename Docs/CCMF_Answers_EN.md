## A. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY (150-200 words)

Sightline is a **B2B SaaS platform** that enables museums and heritage sites to launch immersive AR guides in **30 days**, cutting deployment costs by 80% compared to traditional bespoke solutions.

**Problem:** Museums face a "digital deadlock": custom AR apps cost HK$500k+ and take 6+ months to build, making them inaccessible for most exhibitions. Meanwhile, 70% of visitors disengage with static text labels.

**Solution:** A modular "Content-as-a-Service" platform. Venues pay a setup fee to digitize their space (Digital Twin), then use a self-serve CMS to update AR content instantly. The "Hybrid Anchoring" engine delivers on-object content outdoors (GPS) and indoors (Vision AI) without complex hardware.

**Innovation:** Shift from "One-Off Project" to "Modular Platform." Includes a "Dynamic Q&A Loop" where AI tailors content to the visitor (e.g., Child vs. Historian).

**Market:** 60+ HK museums & 500+ schools.

**6-Month Goal:** Prove the "30-Day Deployment" model with 1 paid pilot at a major HK venue (e.g., Science Museum/Disneyland).

## D. CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION (30%)

### Innovative Technologies

**1. Hybrid AR Anchoring (Core Innovation)**

Traditional AR apps use single-method anchoring (GPS-only or image-only). Sightline dynamically selects the optimal method based on context:

- **Outdoor (GPS-based):** ARCore Geospatial API
  - Latency: p50 <0.6s (GPS lock + API call + anchor placement)
  - Accuracy: ±5-15m (sufficient for landmarks >10m)
  - Coverage: Any outdoor location with GPS signal

- **Indoor (Vision-based):** Quest 3 Passthrough Camera API + Gemini Vision AI
  - Latency: p50 <1.5s (frame capture + AI inference + 2D→3D conversion)
  - Accuracy: ±0.5m (raycast to detected object surface)
  - Coverage: Any well-lit interior with distinct visual features

- **Fallback (High-Precision):** Vuforia Area Target (optional)
  - **Leveraging Disney-Grade Tech:** Uses the same "Area Target" technology the founder deployed for HK Disneyland's AR fireworks.
  - Latency: p50 <1.2s (image recognition + pose estimation)
  - Accuracy: ±5cm (pre-scanned environment)
  - Coverage: Museums, galleries (requires one-time scanning)

**Technical Differentiation:**
- **The "Dynamic Q&A Loop":** Shift from static labels to a conversational loop: **See → Anchor → Ask → Overlay**. The AI adapts the answer to the user (e.g., Engineer vs. Historian context).
- **Confidence state machine:** Green (≥0.85) / Amber (0.60-0.85) / Grey (<0.60)
- **Graceful degradation:** If GPS drifts, system prompts "Re-aim camera to lock"
- **Cross-device consistency:** Same POI data on phone, Quest 3, future glasses

**2. Cutting-Edge Platform APIs**

- **Meta Quest 3 Passthrough Camera API** (Experimental, OS v74+)
  - Direct camera access for MR experiences
  - 2D→3D conversion via Environment Raycast Manager
  - Enables indoor POI detection without pre-scanning

- **Unity Sentis** (On-device ML)
  - Local image preprocessing before cloud API calls
  - Reduces bandwidth and improves privacy

- **ARCore Geospatial API** (Google)
  - VPS (Visual Positioning System) for cm-level outdoor accuracy in select areas
  - Streetscape Geometry for leader line edge-snapping

**3. Performance Breakthrough: <2s Time-to-First-Value**

Industry average for AR content loading: 5-8 seconds (Niantic Lightship, museum AR apps).

Sightline achieves p50 ≤2.0s through:
- Parallel processing: GPS + API call + anchor setup in concurrent threads
- Response caching: 50m grid tiles cache POI data (10-min TTL)
- Predictive prefetch: Load nearby POIs when user is within 100m
- Optimized asset pipeline: Cards rendered as lightweight billboards (<50KB each)

**Measurable KPIs:**
- GPS path: p50 latency 0.4-0.6s (tested at Clock Tower)
- Vision path: p50 latency 1.2-1.5s (tested indoors with poster mockup)
- Anchor stability: ≥10s continuous lock while walking 3-4m

### Creative Solutions

**1. Leader Line Visualization**

**Problem:** Users lose track of which AR card refers to which object (occlusion, clutter).

**Solution:** Dynamic SVG line from anchor point to card, with:
- Edge-snapping: Line follows building edges (using Streetscape Geometry)
- Depth-aware: Line fades when object is behind user
- Visual hierarchy: Thicker line = higher confidence lock

**2. Far-Field Bearing Billboard**

**Problem:** GPS accuracy degrades beyond 100m; can't anchor to distant landmarks (IFC @ 2km).

**Solution:** Bearing-based billboard with distance chip:
- Calculate bearing/elevation from user pose to landmark
- Render card in that direction (not world-locked)
- Display "IFC · 2.1 km" to set expectation
- Hand off to local anchoring when user approaches <100m

**3. Confidence Gating UI**

**Problem:** Binary lock/fail creates frustration (flickers, false positives).

**Solution:** Three-state system with clear user feedback:
- **Green:** Locked, show full card + enable interactions
- **Amber:** Uncertain, show 2 nearest POI chips, prompt "Which one?"
- **Grey:** Searching, show "Steady camera..." hint

### Disruptive Capability

**Disrupts Traditional Museum Audio Guides:**
- Audio guides: Passive, requires manual selection ("Press 7 for artifact")
- Sightline: Active, automatic recognition ("Look at artifact → instant info")

**Disrupts Existing AR Heritage Apps:**
- Competitors require app-specific setup, pre-scanning, or GPS-only (fails indoors)
- Sightline: Zero setup, works indoor/outdoor, adapts to environment

**Market Impact:**
- Reduces museum onboarding friction from 5 min (download app, choose audio guide) to <30s (scan QR, point phone)
- Enables "walk-up" experiences: Tourists at Clock Tower get info immediately without prior planning

### Emerging / Breakthrough Problem-Solving

**Problem:** AR glasses adoption blocked by content scarcity (chicken-egg).

**Breakthrough:** Build phone-first content library NOW; port to glasses LATER (Quest 3 validates architecture).

**Technical Foresight:**
- Same backend API serves phone, Quest 3, future Ray-Ban Meta
- AR card UI designed for peripheral vision (glasses UX pattern)
- Voice I/O roadmap (hands-free glasses interaction)

**Industry Timing:**
- Meta Orion prototype (Sep 2024) validates consumer AR glasses pathway
- Ray-Ban Meta (Nov 2023) selling faster than expected; camera+AI proven
- Apple Vision Pro (Feb 2024) demonstrates spatial computing demand

Sightline positions as content layer ready for "Year of AR Glasses" (2026-2027).

- Lesson plan templates: "Tsim Sha Tsui Heritage Walk" (90-min session)
- Progress tracking: Teachers see which POIs students engaged with

### 2. Cultural Heritage Preservation

**Problem:** HK's heritage knowledge at risk as older generations pass; youth engagement low.

**Solution:** Immersive AR storytelling makes history tangible:
- Clock Tower: "Built 1915, last remnant of Kowloon-Canton Railway terminus"
- Star Ferry: "Continuous service since 1888; 70,000 passengers daily"
- Blue House Cluster: "Grade I historic building; community preservation success story"

**Measurable Impact:**
- Target: 20-30% increase in student dwell time at heritage sites (vs. baseline)
- Target: 80%+ student satisfaction rating ("Made history more interesting")
- Long-term: Build archive of 200+ HK heritage POIs (community resource)

### 3. Open Source Contribution

**Commitment to "Progressive" Technologies:**

- **Quest 3 POI Detection Script** (MIT License)
  - Published as companion to Meta's Passthrough Camera API samples

### 4. Ethical Decision-Making

**Privacy-First Design:**
- No facial recognition (explicitly rejected feature requests)
- Blur faces/license plates before Vision API upload (client-side processing)
- Minimal data collection: POI query logs only (anonymized)
- GDPR-style consent flows (opt-in for usage analytics)

**Content Safety:**
- User-generated notes ("XR love-locks"): Profanity filter + moderation queue
- Museum content: Reviewed by venue curators (no AI hallucinations in education)
- Transparency: Display method (geo/vision), latency, confidence on every query

**Ethical Monetization:**
- No dark patterns (e.g., paywalls on school content)
- Sponsored layers are clearly labeled, user must opt-in
- Revenue from venues (B2B), not surveillance advertising (rejected model)

### 5. Solving Social Problems from Environment

**Problem 1: Low Museum Engagement**
- HK Museum of History reports <40% of student visitors engage beyond lobby
- Sightline solution: Scavenger hunt missions → 60%+ completion target

**Problem 2: Passive Tourism**
- 78% of tourists want "local insights" but get generic guidebook info
- Sightline solution: Contextual stories ("This Star Ferry captain worked here 40 years")

**Problem 3: Digital Divide**
- Elderly residents excluded from smartphone-era tourism tools
- Sightline solution: Voice I/O, large text, simplified UI (Month 7+ accessibility roadmap)

| **Sightline (us)** | Heritage education | "On-object answers, outdoor+indoor" | Hybrid (GPS+Vision) | ✅ | ✅ Quest 3 | Free edu, B2B SDK | Zero-setup hybrid anchoring; heritage-focused; HK-first |

### Key Differentiators

**1. Zero-Setup Hybrid Anchoring**
- Competitors: Either GPS-only (fails indoors) OR image-only (requires pre-scanning)
- Sightline: Adapts to environment automatically

**2. Heritage Education Focus**
- Competitors: General-purpose or gaming-oriented
- Sightline: Content designed for students, co-created with educators

**3. <2s Time-to-First-Value**
- Competitors: 5-8s average (Niantic Lightship, museum apps)
- Sightline: p50 ≤2.0s through caching + parallel processing

**4. HK Context-Aware**
- Competitors: Generic global platforms
- Sightline: HK POI database, Traditional Chinese, local partnerships

**5. Glasses-Ready Architecture**
- Competitors: Phone-only or proprietary hardware (Vision Pro)
- Sightline: Quest 3 validated, ready for Ray-Ban Meta / future devices

### Market Positioning

**Not competing with:** Google Lens (no AR anchoring), Niantic (gaming focus).

**Directly competing with:** Museum-specific AR apps, Vuforia enterprise solutions.

**Competitive Moat: "The Relationship Firewall"**
1.  **Trusted Vendor Status:** We are an approved vendor for HK's most demanding clients (Disney, Telecoms). Competitors with "better tech" cannot penetrate these bureaucratic firewalls easily.
2.  **Idea Scarcity:** Sightline is a rare "Deep Tech Consumer Play" in a HK startup ecosystem saturated with generic e-commerce/fintech apps.
3.  **Local Context:** We understand HK's unique density/verticality challenges (which break generic GPS apps) and solve them with hybrid anchoring.

**Why Hong Kong? (The "Unfair Advantage")**
- **High-Value Density:** HK has 60+ museums/venues in a tiny geographic area. We can service 10 clients with 1 field team.
- **Testbed for Asia:** If it works in HK's complex urban canyon environment (Clock Tower, Central), it works anywhere.
- **Gateway:** Validating with "Global Brand" clients in HK (Disney) creates instant credibility for expansion to Singapore/Japan.

## J. RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: GPS Drift Outdoors (±5-15m)**
- **Probability:** High (inherent to consumer GPS)
- **Impact:** Medium (anchor appears offset from landmark)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Confidence state machine shows amber when GPS uncertainty >10m
  - Vision AI fallback: User can tap "Re-lock with camera"
  - Far-field bearing mode for >100m distances (no precise anchor needed)
- **Early Test:** Field test at Clock Tower (Month 1) to measure actual drift; adjust radius thresholds

**Risk 2: Vision AI Latency Spikes (>2s)**
- **Probability:** Medium (Gemini API variability)
- **Impact:** Medium (user experience degradation)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Local caching: POI responses cached by 50m grid tiles (10-min TTL)
  - Parallel requests: Send GPS + Vision API calls simultaneously, use whichever returns first
  - Timeout handling: If API >3s, show "Re-aim to lock" prompt
- **Early Test:** Stress test API with 100 sample images (Month 1) to establish p90 latency baseline

**Risk 3: Quest 3 Passthrough Camera API Changes**
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (experimental API, OS v74+)
- **Impact:** High (indoor demo breaks)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Phone-first strategy: Quest 3 is enhancement, not MVP blocker
  - Meta's sample code provides stable baseline (tested by community)
  - Fallback: Use Vuforia Image Targets if Passthrough API deprecated
- **Early Test:** Build Quest 3 prototype in Month 2 (Week 1) to validate API stability

### Market Risks

**Risk 4: "Big System Integrators Copy Us"**
- **Probability:** Medium (if we prove the market).
- **Impact:** High.
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Speed:** By the time an SI scopes a project, we are already live (30-day deploy).
  - **CMS Lock-in:** We embed our "Content Management System" into the museum's workflow. Once curators are trained on Sightline, they won't want to switch.
  - **Niche IP:** "Hybrid Anchoring" (GPS+Vision) is hard to get right; generalist SIs usually fail at the "last meter" accuracy.

**Risk 5: Museum Pilot Rejection (No LOI)**
- **Probability:** Medium.
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Offer the "30-Day Challenge":** "Give us one exhibit and 30 days. If you don't like it, don't pay."
  - **Start Small:** Target specific "Pain Point" exhibits (e.g., the Mona Lisa crowd control) rather than whole-museum overhauls.

### Team Risks

**Risk 6: Unity Contractor Availability**
- **Probability:** Medium (HK AR talent pool is small)
- **Impact:** High (blocks Unity development)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start recruiting Week 2 (after backend is functional)
  - Interview 3-5 candidates, select based on portfolio + availability
  - Backup plan: Founder extends timeline by 2-4 weeks, handles Unity work (has basic Unity experience)
  - Contract structure: Milestone-based payments (not hourly) to align incentives
- **Early Test:** Post job listing in Week 1 to gauge response rate

**Risk 7: Founder Burnout (Full-time Commitment)**
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (6 months is manageable)
- **Impact:** High (project delays)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Realistic scope: 40 hrs/week planned, not 80 hrs/week crunch
  - Weekly standups with advisor/mentor for accountability
  - Contingency budget: Can hire extra help if needed
  - Health practices: Regular breaks, field testing doubles as outdoor time

### Operational Risks

**Risk 8: Cloud Cost Overrun (Gemini Vision API)**
- **Probability:** Low (caching mitigates)
- **Impact:** Low (budget buffer exists)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Aggressive caching: 50m grid tiles, 10-min TTL
  - Rate limiting: 100 requests/min per device
  - Budget alert: Set Google Cloud billing alert at HK$8,000 (before HK$10K cap)
  - Fallback: If costs spike, temporarily disable Vision API, use GPS-only mode
- **Monitoring:** Weekly cost review in Google Cloud Console

## K. EXIT STRATEGY / SUSTAINABILITY PLAN

### Scenario 1: Successful Pilot → CIP Application (Primary Path)

**Timeline:** Month 6 (Jul 2026)

**Criteria for Success:**
- ≥1 signed pilot LOI from museum/school
- ≥50 beta users with ≥80% satisfaction
- p50 latency ≤2.0s achieved
- Teacher trial testimonial video

**Next Steps:**
- Apply to CIP (Cyberport Incubation Programme) Jul 2026 intake
- CIP funding: HK$500K (up to HK$1M total over 24 months)
- Use CIP funds to: Scale to 50 venues, hire 2 FTE (Unity dev + sales), glasses R&D

**Revenue Transition:**
- Month 7-12: Onboard 10 paying venues (Venue SDK @ HK$10K/year avg = HK$100K ARR)
- Month 13-24: Scale to 50 venues (HK$500K ARR, operational break-even)

---

### Scenario 2: Pivot to Open-Source (If Pilot Fails)

**Timeline:** Month 6 (Jul 2026)

**Trigger:** Unable to secure museum pilot OR <60% student satisfaction in trial

**Action:**
- Open-source entire codebase (MIT License)
- Position as community resource for HK AR developers
- Founder transitions to part-time maintenance while seeking FT employment
- Archive POI database as public HK heritage dataset

**Value Preserved:**
- 20 POIs documented (community benefit)
- Quest 3 integration learnings shared (open-source contribution)
- Failed fast within 6 months (vs. 2-year drag)

---

### Scenario 3: Acquisition by Education Platform (Best Case)

**Timeline:** Month 12-18 (Post-CIP)

**Potential Acquirers:**
- EdTech platforms (e.g., Snapask, TabSquare) looking to add AR capability
- Museum tech vendors (e.g., Bloomberg Connects, Cuseum)
- Google Arts & Culture (integration into Lens)

**Valuation Drivers:**
- 50+ venue partnerships (distribution moat)
- 200+ POI content library (asset value)
- Proven hybrid anchoring tech (IP value)
- 100K+ MAU (user base)

**Exit Terms:**
- Founder stays on 12-24 months for transition
- Venue partnerships migrate to acquirer's platform
- Free school tier preserved as acquisition condition

---

### Long-Term Vision (Independence Path)

**Month 24+ (Post-CIP):**
- Self-sustaining business: 50-100 venue SDK subscriptions
- Revenue: HK$500K-1M ARR
- Team: 3-5 FTE (dev, sales, support)
- Expand to Asia-Pacific museums (Singapore, Taiwan, Japan)
- Glasses partnerships (Ray-Ban Meta official launch partner)

**Mission Preservation:**
- Free tier for HK schools remains forever (core social commitment)
- 10% revenue to heritage preservation NGOs (social enterprise model)
- Annual open-source contributions (Quest 3 samples, AR best practices)

---

## L. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

**Ownership:**
- All code, content, and IP developed under CCMF belongs to Principal Applicant / Company
- No IP conflicts with prior employers or projects
- Open-source components (Meta samples, Unity packages) properly attributed

**Trademarks:**
- "Sightline" name search conducted (no conflicts in HK registry)
- Will register trademark if CIP proceeds (Month 7+)

**Patents:**
- No patent applications planned (software is better protected via execution speed)
- Defensive publication strategy: Open-source selected components to prevent competitor patents

---

## M. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

**Privacy (PDPO - Personal Data Privacy Ordinance):**
- Minimal data collection: POI query logs only (no PII required)
- Privacy policy published: Discloses Vision API usage, data retention (30 days)
- User consent: Opt-in for analytics, clear "camera active" indicator

**Safety:**
- AR safety warnings: "Watch your surroundings while using app"
- Designed for stationary use (not walking with phone up)
- Teacher trial: Adult supervision required for students <16

**Accessibility:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance target (large text, high contrast, voice I/O roadmap)

**Content:**
- Museum content: Reviewed by venue curators (no AI hallucinations)
- User-generated notes: Moderation queue, profanity filter
- No prohibited content (political, religious, adult) in public POIs
